            "Andhoon mei kaama raja bro.\n\nWhole pakistan works on this model. Everything is bad but just something that is less bad thinks k its actually the best in the world.\n\nStill LUMS is impressive in its own rights and ofcourse PR and market reputation may ne over inflated still theres no denying it attracts the best local pakistani talent.\n\nStill LUMs is not the ultimate end and there are many good and much affordable unis even in pak that offer great post study career opportunities and thats a solid tried and proved fact.",
            "I've been to 3 of the major universities in Pakistan. I have studied in US too. fuck the rankings all of us know there are objective standards if followed to the letter youll go a notch up. But things like how open a university is to enable free thought and propel self awareness of a student can't be quantified. And within that criteria, Lums is pretty up there. \n\nIn every other university of Pakistan, there is some level of control of ideas cloaked as DISCIPLINE AKA DANDA. don't get me wrong, Lums has rules too, but the enforcement is mostly expected from students by themselves. The idea is to give them rules and give them trust. Don't spy or employ humiliating tactics to enforce the rules. Give them liberty and treat the students like adults. Because that is when they will make their own decisions. Without fear,but only with responsibility.",

I say this based on my own experience.\n\nRecently, I visited LUMS for the Integration Bee competition organized by LSMS (LUMS Society of Mathematics), and oh my God — their buildings, their faculty, the infrastructure, and that aesthetic cafeteria — it’s all on another level.\n\nHonestly, I’ve run out of words to describe how incredibly impressive LUMS is.

And I just want to share this chapter with the people who’ve unknowingly walked it with me — thank you 💟.\n\nAn year ago, I gave mdcat. Didn’t make it. even though I never truly wanted to be a doctor that failure hit me hard. My family, the people around me they didn’t let me forget it either. I started to think that maybe this is it. Maybe my shine really has ended.\n\nThen I applied here just because everyone else was doing it. My relatives said it to my face, You couldn’t make it in med, how do you think you’ll make it to Lums? And even if you do  who’s going to pay the fee? They were right. We didn’t have the resources. But I still had a hope .\n\nSpent a whole month writing my PS, stayed up on hopeless nights, not knowing what I was doing, just doing it. Then SAT prep I had no clue about. But soo many of you helped beyond what I could ask for. Scored well. And then came the long wait.\n\nMy mom used to say, If it’s not written in your fate, don’t be stubborn with God. And every time, I’d say If it’s not written, I’ll plead with Him to write it. Because I want it that badly.\nand today she is soo proud while telling that exact line to relatives.\n\nI got accepted on May 5th  but it didn’t feel like an admission. Because we knew we couldn’t afford it. So I celebrated quietly and waited \n\nAnd today I got the mail I’ve been granted 80% feet waiver .\nIt’s official.\nI’m going to LUMS. Sameer from a small town .\n\nThis year has been the most difficult, most transformative year of my life. Every breakdown, every insult, every hopeless moment worth it. I don’t know what I did to deserve this, but I know one thing Allah is kind beyond imagination. I’m just grateful.\n\nTo everyone still waiting  I pray you get what you’ve worked and prayed for.\nTo everyone who made it  we made it.\nAnd to those who were with me in this - thank you. Always.\n\nToday, my parents hugged me with pride.\nToday it all made sense.\n\n“Jo milna hota h zindagi me vo mil ke hi rhta h usko ni koi rook skta! ”",

Just a few hours back, I posted in this subreddit about how my weak financial situation was holding me back from applying to LUMS despite my best efforts. I have never encountered such kind individuals in my entire life—not even my relatives.\n\nWhen my mother asked my relatives for help, she received taunts like, “Jab nahi auqaat LUMS mai parhnay ki tou kyu tumhara beta udhar apply kar raha hai? Kahan se 20-25 lac dogi saal kay? Aqal ko haath maro, bibi.” It’s crazy how the people who are related to us by blood don’t even bother helping us in our hard times, but the strangers who don’t even know us help us in ways we cannot imagine.\n\nAfter my post, many kind people came forward to offer me help—and indeed, they did. All I heard was my mom’s words: “Beta, Allah waseelay bananay wala hai. Koi baat nahi, hosla karo.” I cannot thank these two kind individuals enough who helped me. I don’t know if I should say their names or if they would be okay with it due to privacy concerns. But I really want to thank D.S Bhai and Z.A Api. Believe me, the amount of prayers pouring out of my mouth is off the charts. I’ll always remember these two kind individuals for their kindness. I pray that you both get success in every phase of your life, and may Allah shower all of His blessings and love upon you.\n\nSome people really leave a long-lasting impact on you. You can forget many moments, but you can never forget such kind moments. I’m 18 now, but I’m sure even when I’m 81, I’ll still remember these two people who helped me. I’m beyond grateful to everyone who helped me from my post—I mean every word. Some may find this cringe or feel like koi contestant reality show mai apni dukhi story suna raha hai, but this is what I feel right now. I’m truly indebted to both of these kind people, and I’ve written their names in my notes. InshAllah, I’ll pay them back a month or later.\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!!!",

Life at home was tough — I’ve faced more family issues than most people can imagine. But maybe that’s what drew me toward mental health — I wanted to understand what breaks people… and how to help them heal.\n\nAfter matric, my mother took a bold step for me. We left our village and came to Lahore, so I could get an education.\nI chose Humanities, and believe me — even that was a fight. Everyone around me questioned it. “Ye kya subject hai?” “Iska kya faida?”\nBut I kept going. I worked hard — day and night — and I got 1st position in the board in Humanities.\n\nMy dream? LUMS.\nPeople laughed. They said:\n\n“Villages ke bachay LUMS nahin ja saktay.”\n“Tum se nahi hoga.”\n“Tum kisi qabil nahi ho.”\n\nStill, I believed. I applied to HSS at LUMS because I love social sciences — because I love understanding people.\n\nI waited. Prayed.\nThere was no guide, no mentor. Just me and Allah.\nToday, on 3rd August, I got my rejection.\n\nAnd honestly… I broke.\n\nI don’t know where I went wrong.\nBut all the voices that once mocked me — they just got louder.\nTheir taunts feel true today.\nAnd I’m drowning in “tum se nahi ho paya.”\n\nYes, I already cleared the PU test, and yes — I still want to study mental health.\nBut now I see even PU being mocked — I read a comment on Reddit:\n\n“PU kaun jata hai?”\n\nMery family lahore se bahir allow nhi krty tou lahore mai mujhy phir social sciences mai yhi option mila Punjab university ka 😭\n\nIt hurt more than I expected.\nEven the ones who got into LUMS — they joke about students like me.\nAs if effort means nothing unless it ends in prestige.\n\nBut maybe…\nMaybe worth isn’t decided by admission emails.\nMaybe the ones who fall and rise again are stronger than those who never knew the ground.\n\nTo anyone else who got rejected — you’re not alone.\nAnd to anyone who’s from a small town, a struggling family, or a village they don’t even mention proudly — you belong here too.\n\nThis rejection isn’t the end of my story.\nMaybe it’s the beginning of a different kind of success.\n\nPray for me.\n\n— Amna 🌸\n",

It's just that we do not know what He knows, and sometimes we try our best to achieve something which, actually, isn't beneficial for us, or which may instead be harmful for us. Because, remember, Allah is closer to us than even our jugular vain, and His love for us is unconditional. No one can love us more than Allah (swt), our creator.. Therefore, He can never be unjust with us.\n\nSo, when we give our 100% effort for anything, after that, all we need to do is to just leave everything else upon Allah! We shouldn't really be worried about what the result would turn out to be after that point.. because, when we have already done all we could, all that was in our control.. now just leaving the matters to the Best Disposer of affairs is the next best thing we can do! And that's also exactly what Allah (swt) wants from us.. to give our best and then to leave the results of it upon Allah, having this trust in heart that now whatever shall the result be, it'll be the best for myself. \n\nYeah, at times, Allah does test us by both giving and taking things that we love. In such moments, Allah just wants to check if our love for those worldly things is stronger than our love for our creator. After we get the thing we desired for so long, will we turn back to Allah in gratitude? Or if we lose something we loved, will we accept it as Allah's choice for us and remain grateful?\n\nRemember sis, this world (duniya) and its life is a test for all of us at the end of the day.. nothing here is permanent, and nothing will stay with us or benefit us, except for our deeds and actions, in the long term. So, think of all these challenging situations in ur life as opportunities to gain Allah's happiness and to get closer to him.. Because the harder our tests are in this world, the better the rewards will be for us in the hereafter, if we manage to emerge successful from those tests.\n\nI would love to share the following verses of the Holy Quran with you, which have always been a great source of comfort and calmness for me in moments of distress..👇\n\n**Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor has He become displeased with you. And surely what is going to come after will be better for you than that which has gone before. And soon will your Lord give you so much that you shall be well-pleased. (Surah Ad-Duha 93:3-5)**\n\n**\"They plan, and Allah plans, and surely Allah is The Best of the planners.\" (Surah Al-Anfal 8:30)**\n\nJust keep ur trust in Allah's plans, and have this belief that whatever happened was actually the best in your interest. Thank Allah for it, and keep working hard and continue making the most of the opportunities that Allah provides you with! \n\nBest of luck for ur future, and may Allah succeed u in all endeavours of ur life! 🤲👍",

            "Hi OP , I get you , that is how I felt when I was waiting for my decision for Lums 2 years ago. But let me tell you something , LUMS is far from what we think it is. It is really not what we all think it is , It won't turn around your life , it just adds a fancy name to the outlook you're trynna get. \nAs for the people that mocked or belittled you , It's 2025 and if that is still how people are acting , we are actually doomed , especially if those knob-heads have gotten into LUMS too. You're young , life doesn't end here. \n\nHonest Advice : Enroll in some uni in Lahore for any major , whilst give SATs/LCAT to majorly improve your chances of getting into LUMS. Im open to Help you for the Application till the Financial Aid Application for the upcoming year. You'll definitely get in , it really is not that hard trust me. Keep your chin up Amna , us lot have it way better than those elite-class wanna be colonizers douche-bags. Cheers.",
            "As far as Ive seen, lums isn’t as holistic as it claims to be! I think they don’t really care about your board position, distinctions or even your fsc marks. I had a 96% too and a board position, just like you! but still, the story ended the same way! no proper guidance, no support, just pressure from every direction especially during the gap year. I got rejected two months ago. Maybe it was because of the personal statement, my ecs, or the lcat and I honestly don’t even know\nBut you know what? I’ve realized something important now that Life is so much bigger than lums!\nAlhamdulillah, Im doing something else now and I truly believe it’s far better for me than lums ever would’ve been. Sometimes you just have to let go and go with the flow! Jahan bhi Allah taala le jaayen just trust the path and walk it with faith bas!\nBest of luck for your future!

            "I'm sorry for typing out such a drawn-out paragraph but if you happen to read this rant, please share some advice. I have no idea of what I am to do rn everything is a mess.\n\nSo, I got accepted into unis in the US with about 70 percent scholarship being the max, earlier this year. Thing is - when i applied, like most of my peers I wasn't expecting anything and even if I got in I primarily just applied for the sake of it. Then i got in and we didn't know what to do bc the idea of sending your kid to a whole new country was def something to at least ponder over for a bit. Not to mention, the 20-30 percent tuition fee + living expense i had to cover for was still substantial, although we could make it happen. There were also some issues with applying for a visa given my passport needs to be reissued and such which was impossible to resolve before I turned 18- that being this coming October. So I emailed my unis a deferment request and my parents kept it as a safe option we'd consider later when I was eligible. I gave local uni tests like everyone and got into giki. On a side note, while they admit to being open to all options they are inclined to send me to giki, which was not explicitly stated but i got the idea. And I have chances of getting in other reputable local unis too. Now I have absolutely no idea of what to do. Every few months now, I'm figuring my life out at 1 am in the morning. Then lies the problem of my A-level final result. Now I was no stellar kid but after expecting A's and at worst B's last year I landed a BBC. So to say the least, I'm not exactly excited and I have no idea of what to expect at all this time I just pray. I gave accelerated papers for my C sub I flunked in AS and..a module got leaked, others were of varied difficulty. As for the other alevel papers too I'm just not sure anymore. So yea, I prepared for the best and expect the worst. Now for my worst case scenario, that's where I begin to consider a gap year. I'm honestly skeptical because everyone has their own take on the matter- some say it can really be a life changer if you get a grip and grind, others say its depressing and I need a damn good reason to take a year off. The good reason could be that I am a little half-baked on the discipline I chose for my UG. I won't admit it because my mum's in academia and she actually teaches the discipline at a different uni and she insists it'll be fine, I also have tried talking about it once, but then- i wasn't so sure myself. I felt i just confused us both, and yea it didn't pan out the way I wished it would. I wasn't exactly pressurized into the choice either, I was fickle minded and there was no scope for the fields I wanted to pursue, locally. In given scenario where i try a gap year I would then apply for those disciplines (astrophysics, psychology), because there is in fact scope abroad which I did not consider at the time because I was so fixated on my a levels-the current ordeal at hand, and trying to fit myself into this mould of limited options. i lacked in planning. I would give the SAT which I didn't give when i applied the first time and that would likely increase my scholarship. I considered a gap year otherwise too, even if my alevel results pan out in my favor. I have the option of freezing the term apparently, so I can take time to marinate over what I want to do with myself. Or I can always just leap out to uni immediately in a month's time and continue the hustle and hope I was merely overthinking it all and eventually find interest in the discipline.",

            "There have been reports that the victim has been identified. Her family doesn't want to speak up because they want to protect their honour. They are also receiving threats. \n\n\n I'm a student at this campus. The way the faculty is handling the entire situation just reeks of guilt. They're being dismissive and defensive. Our advisor and class teacher came to our class to tell us that these are nothing but rumours. That we should give a 'shut-up call' to anyone who brings up this topic. Frankly speaking, that's ridiculous. How can you expect the students to NOT talk about this? Choti moti gossip nahi hay, it's a serious allegation which raises safety concerns. Of course, the students are going to discuss it. \n\n\n They placed so much emphasis on how the college's reputation shouldn't be harmed. But they didn't even say a single word to reassure the students that they're investigating the matter and taking due action. That's the entire reason why this escalated so much — because the students didn't feel safe and protected by the management. It was one of my classmates who reached out to newdity.pk and asked them to post this. It was clear as day that the management wouldn't be cooperative. So regardless of whether it was confirmed or not, at that time it seemed like the right thing to do. \n\n\nEven now, the students are being threatened. We're being told that this is fake news and propaganda to malign PGC's name (apparently 16-year-old girls are propagandists and fear-mongers now). People who are participating in protests are being warned that they will be suspended, fined and that they won't receive their roll no. slips.\n\n\nI'm heartbroken because up until yesterday, I was truly enjoying my time at the college. But now, I want nothing to do with it. I feel sick whenever I think about how the teachers who had my respect and admiration were so eager to bury the truth to save their jobs. I don't want to ever see them preach about morality and justice every again. I hate the fact that I still have to spend two more years with them.",
            "If it really is true then the best protest would be to boycott that college and apply elsewhere.  Nothing hurts a businessman more than his money!

        "body": "\n\nThere’s so much I want to say, and no one to really say it to. So I thought I’d post here. Otherwise, the weight will engulf me completely.\n\nAfter years of effort, I finally got admission into LUMS this June. I waited for financial aid, but after months of hoping, I was rejected. The fee deadline was August 13th, and I couldn’t pay.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that I helped so many of my classmates with their LUMS applications. One girl didn’t even know applications were open until I told her. With only two days left, I structured her entire application, guided her essays, and helped build her extracurricular profile. I spent two whole days on it. Every single day people would reach out to me, and I helped them selflessly every single time. I was happy for them when they got in. They were lucky, their parents paid their fees the next day. For most of them, LUMS was the only university they applied to since their decisions came before other entry tests.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m the one who’s left behind.\n\nI come from a small school. My siblings and cousins all went to the “top” schools of Pakistan, while I was constantly looked down on by relatives. They mocked me and taunted me in passive aggressive ways. It wasn’t even my choice, my parents decided my school. And yet, I outperformed them all, always getting better grades.\n\nBut coming from a small school meant I had no opportunities to build a strong student profile. There were no extracurricular activities or events. For two years, I worked endlessly to build one on my own through volunteering, internships, and leadership roles wherever I could find them. I got stellar grades. I got into every single university I applied to. And still, I’m stuck.\n\nI prepared for the SAT for almost a year. I broke down every single concept and studied day and night. I was scoring in the 1500s on practice tests. But just before my actual test, I got very sick and couldn’t sleep for three days, which affected my performance. I still got a good score but not high enough for merit scholarships.\n\nMy parents refused to pay for LUMS after the financial aid rejection. I don’t even blame them, I understand. They’re not in a position to pay almost a crore. But it still hurts, because my sibling who was never serious about studies and barely passed with D’s and C’s was fully supported. My father paid almost 60 lakhs for his prestigious university, including mess and living expenses. He only got in at the last moment off the waitlist. He partied his way through, graduated with a very low GPA, and that was okay.\n\nMeanwhile, I started working and earning at age 17. I now earn 50,000 per month as a freelancer, and it will scale significantly in the coming months. My sibling didn’t earn a single penny during his university years, everything was funded by my father. The university I will attend now is affordable compared to LUMS, but it is very rigorous.\n\nAnd here I am, always at the top of my class, doing everything right, yet ending up at the one university I wanted least. It is a tough place, and I don’t even know if I’ll survive there.\n\nAll that’s left of me is a ball of anger, resentment, frustration, and grief. I know a good Muslim should not be jealous, should stay hopeful and grateful. I’m trying. But I feel broken.\n\nI keep telling myself to look at the people in Gaza, their suffering is beyond words. My misery is nothing compared to theirs. But that only makes me cry harder, because then I see the cruelty and injustice of the world and feel even more helpless.\n\nEvery day I cry until my heart physically hurts. I get panic attacks. When my parents see me cry, they just tell me I’m a headache to them.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I feel invisible, betrayed, and forgotten. I gave everything, and it feels like life still robbed me.\n\nAt LUMS, I had so many visions and goals, most of them tied to bringing a positive impact into other people’s lives. It wasn’t just about studying at a good university. But all of those dreams are beginning to shatter before my eyes.\n\n\n",

Independence and commitment to your goals. These qualities my friend will take u very far in life in shaa Allah. You will definitely be compensated by alot in shaa Allah. Time will tell indeed. You will go somewhere greater and bigger than lums in shaa Allah. \n\nTrust Allah. Have faith. Aim at the ivies for masters. You won't be denied financial aid then iA.

            "Bro i am a third year student at LUMS and trust me this university, as of 2025 it's not even that good it's overhyped and highly overrated. Times are changing industries are moving towards skill based recruiting, even the top MNCs require playing you some critical assessment games online to judge your abilities (you can search about c factor talent game online).\n\nIf you told me 10 years back that LUMS is Worth it i would definitely agree with you but as of now even our professors tell us that lums has lost its brand value, recruiters do not prefer lums grads anymore. Even me and my batchmates who applied for 100s of internships didn't get one. All we saw was companies hiring fast, nust, comsats, lse grads. \n\nLook at how the world is changing, equip yourself with latest skills, incorporate AI in your work, build a strong portfolio and the hardwork you've done all your life im sure Allah will never let it go to waste. 5 years from now you'll be laughing reading this post.\n\nI was in the same boat as of you 2 years ago but now that I'm in LUMS i realize this is nothing literally there is so much in life that starts after this, your undergrad is nothing. \n\nI'm currently interning at PepsiCo and there are only two guys from lums along with me ( that too on reference) others are from all the odd universities. So when i tell you that at high/professional level degrees don't even matter. You'll find ppl from all different backgrounds working together.\n\nBelieve me the world has changed alot in the past few years and lums is just not lums anymore",

You are doing way better than most of us and one day the world will pay you in a way you couldn't even fathom. Just don't loose hope man you will be rewarded",
            "that sucks sm </3 first of all, you sound like an amazing person. you are hardworking, smart, and resilient. you have had stuff not work out for you, your family be rude to you, AND yet you still kept on going. that's actually so admirable!!! \n\nsecondly, i totally get you about parents being unfair. my parents are like that too. but i guess at the end of the day we can't really do anything about our parents. and yeah it stinks but what helps me deal with it is to try to not think about it? i tell myself that i will move out at some point, will have the life i want, and i will be able to help my parents financially without it affecting my mental health. \n\nALSO i know it's awful and you’re hurt which is so valid, but please know that LUMS isn’t what would have make you successful, i mean it definitely would have helped lots, but you sound like someone who knows how to get things done so i am sure you will be successful even if you don’t go to LUMS. \n\nandandand you're not a bad muslim for feeling sad. and i get it. it's hard to not beat yourself up when you list all the things that could be worse or what you have that's good. but feelings are feelings. it's your body reacting to what it's experiencing. you're not bad for feeling things. you have to let yourself expereince it to move past it. \n\nand here if you want to talk or anything. i hope things work out. and i am not sure but can you take a gap year and retake SAT and apply again for merit scholarship again next year?",
            "Not gonna say those quotes TIME HEAL EVERYTHING no it doesnt u just learn how to accept things ,long story short as u mentioned u r earning abhi se means u got urself disciplined enough to get on a track(thats what most of us lack) u automatically r getting into that 1% now ab bat agyi lums ki ya kisi bhi bde BRAND ki to i get it ke u worked so hard and still couldnt get it lkn the kind of person u r(from the post u wrote) u ain't for this rat race branded logos tbh life somtimes test us through most brutal ways CHIN UP AND GET THROUGH IT show urself and them what u can do even if u couldnt get in i know u can and u will🫂",
            "You don't have to be at lums to make something of ur life. I have a bachelor's from a cheaper modest uni (one of the top 10 in my degree), and I am doing masters @ lums atm, paying my own fee alongside work.\n\nIt's fine but I don't think it's a necessity to be here. The classrooms are great (they look great in when I take and send snaps to ppl) but the course quality isn't \"so great that I am amazed\"\n\nYou can argue about the campus life and all but most engineering students are complaining about not having enough time. It is hard and competitive.\n\nTbh it depends on your goals, really. If your goal is to go abroad and do something in xyz country, not being in lums is NOT hindering you in that in any way. In fact, it might be helping you since you can score a great cgpa in whatever uni you're planning to go to now. Just give ur 4 years and get a masters somewhere abroad. No one in your graduate application is going to care if you came from lums. Tons of my bachelors peers did exactly that and most lums kids are planning to do exactly that too.\n\nIf you're in any of the top 10 unis, the local job market does not care which one it is. So the whole point of lums is the \"clout\" which imo is overpriced as heck and as a person studying at lums rn it is the worst investment I could've done. I should've bought a plot because there's nothing that \"great\" here lol.",

            "never let anyone make us feel like we have to compromise on personal moral standards in order to ‘fit in’, i’m sure the uni experience will only be enhanced by being clear about our boundaries. plus, it’s always a win bcoz by doing so we attract the right people into our lives",
            "Yes you'll find plenty of religious female friends don't worry. There's even a WhatsApp group chat solely for women who want to find other hijabis/niqabis to socialise with and spend time in a halal way only (no guys, gossip etc.) When you join the campus you can DM me and I'll get you added there - if you want!\n\nBut the reputation about LUMS is still true, maybe even understated. This 100 acre campus has to have the highest concentration of atheists/agnostics in all of Pakistan.",
            "(not from lums, actually I'm a nustian) In general I've noticed it really depends upon you. You get judged a part of society judges you for wearing hijab while others might judge you for not wearing. In my uni. There are people that completely changed their personality and there are those who still respect their boundaries made from their beliefs. Lastly, be clear about your boundaries with others you always end up finding the right people and yes you yourself don't judge others. Be kind and helpful and expressive,these traits in general help in uni. As I'm in my final year now, i would like to advise you to live it well and strike a balance. In the end it's all in you !  never let anyone else dictate.\nBest of luck.",
            "LUMS is pretty open to all people and in the last 4 years, it has only become more religious. The only judgement these days is on areligious people,  so You are sure to be inculcated into the culture. \nBe You, find common minded people (you will find them), and enjoy one of the only places in Pakistan where religion is not the criterion for judgement at most parts (Following or not).",
            "LUMS is an amazing place. Theres a culture of tolerance and acceptance so you dont need to change yourself, your practices and your belief for anyone. People are encouraged to be respectful to others and once you go there, you’ll see that your hijab or religious belief are not the handicap people portray them to be. At the same time, please extend the same respect to people who follow a different set of values and beliefs. Well done on getting into LUMS. Wishing you all the best.",
            "LUMS has two extremes. Going to lums for a year now, never have a felt more alive and at place because of the diversity. Most mature students should respect you and your beliefs. Making friends is something I can’t say, but definitely you’ll get a very solid network in lahore.

I got my offer on the very last date of acceptances (31st July), which felt like a huge relief.

Alhamdullilah i have very good credentials, 8A* in OL , 3As in AS and a 1560 SAT. My ECA’s are also very good. I missed the chance of applying abroad as i couldn’t afford heavy fees of counselors and also got rejected in the ED-1 results and Early Action. Dissapointed i did not apply to any other unis abroad. LUMS always has been my dream school in Pakistan and now that the “bahir parhnay ka khwaab” is completely gone. LUMS is my last resort. I really wanna attend LUMS. \nMy family condition is extremely weak financially. We depend on my father’s pension for our expenses.I tried many times to get a job in pakistan but jahan graduates ko nahi milti wahan aik a level kay bachay ko kya hi job milegi. I tried freelancing too but that is so inconsistent, mahinon baad jaakr koi 1-2 freelance works miltey hain. It was extremely burdensome for my my family to even fund my OL education but alhamdullilah i got a 100% scholorship in my A levels on basis of my o level result. Even paying the SAT fee was hell. I remember i had to save 8 months in advance just to give the test. Long story short , my family doesn’t even have 10k rn so that i can pay my application fee. My younger brother broke his leg last week or uspar acha khasa medical bill bana tha , now we literallyhave 10-12k left for entire month , agar yay bhi maine application fee pr laga diye tou ghar ka kharcha khatam hojayega. I don’t know what to do. I feel like crying atp. I emailed lums several times requesting for a fee waiver but despite my several attempts i did not get any response from them. Is there anything i can do rn ? \nLife is so unfair sometimes. Puri mehnat karnay kay bawujood apnay dream school nahi jaa sakta hu. Im not being ungrateful or anything or na hi apnay parents ko blame kar raha hu. hamesha shukar sabar se kaam liya hai but jab yay realize karta hu kay apna 200% dekar bhi , har wou cheez jo mere qabu mai wou karne kay bawujood bhi jab phal na miley tou dukh hota hai. khair chalo competition hi kam hogaya hai , aik acha deserving candidate phirse lums nahi jaa payega :). I wish education was more accessible to the low income people in Pakistan.",

If you have money to spend there’s mxj store as well but it’s pricey \n\nIf you want something more formal but still casual lama is what usually recommend. Outfitters isn’t bad for that as well. Attir is good as well \n\nFor lowers there’s a lot of options. I would recommend getting jeans that aren’t tight, getting more of that baggy look. Get a blue pair of jeans, one black, and one that has that washed look. Would also recommend getting a pair of cargo. Groovy and checkmate atelier are my go to but there’s a lot of options out there.

        "body": "Greetings, dear applicants. I hope you all are doing well. LUMS admission for the Fall of 2025 has now officially begun. With the early stages of the application process, candidates have started off with their application process and are going to ramp up the momentum over the coming weeks. \n\nTo emphasize the importance of time, there are three essential stages for the LUMS admission process. Just like there are three stages of the metamorphosis of human development, three stages of storytelling and even three stages of sleep. Similarly, for any college application, some individuals like to begin early to get a head start over everyone else. Then there are those who start later in the middle stage where there’s enough time to cover up every aspect without any urgency, and at last, there are those who get the realization to get started at the very end, or else it's over for them. \n\nTherefore, this post is for early grinders who want to get ahead in the application process, particularly with their Personal Statement essay. **So for those who need Personal Statement Samples for previously accepted applicants (2022, 2023, and 2024), feel free to reach out or comment down below, and I’ll reach out to you myself.** \n\nNote: If I haven't reached out to any individual who commented below, I will text you sooner or later. Your patience is appreciated.  ",

        "body": "This might be long, but I hope someone out there reads it.\nI’ve been told to “move on” so many times I’ve lost count, but some things don’t just fade. Especially when you were 17 and expected protection—and instead got destroyed by the very people meant to keep you safe.\n\nI’m from Pakistan. I studied at HITEC College Taxila for my FSC (high school). I went there willingly—actually convinced my parents to let me join, because it had a “reputation” for discipline, education, and structure. That decision ended up changing my life—but in the worst way imaginable.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the hostel, I realized I was in a toxic, unsafe environment. I was roomed with three students who made my life hell. One of them, Haris Sikandar, waited until I went home one weekend and then broke into my cupboard. He tore up my notebooks, shredded my textbooks, threw my clothes in the bin, and completely wrecked my space. Azan Khaliq, another student (not even my roommate), stole my AirPods and my football shoes.\n\nI did what anyone would do. I reported it. First to the hostel warden, Askar Zaman, who showed zero interest. Then to the hostel manager, Lt Colonel (Retd.) Muhammad Farooq Ahmed—who not only dismissed my complaints but demanded a bribe from my father to take action. Later, I found out that he even ordered the deletion of CCTV footage that could have proven everything I said.\n\nDesperate, my parents and I reached out to the college principal. His response? “The hostel isn’t under my jurisdiction.” Because apparently, the college and hostel admins were at odds—and students were just collateral damage.\n\nI felt completely powerless. I had evidence. I had support. I had done nothing wrong. But the system closed ranks and told me: “You’re on your own.”\nNo action. No justice. No protection. No consequences—for anyone except me.\n\nWhat did that do to a teenage boy who was already introverted?\nIt broke me.\n\nI now live with Complex PTSD. I have depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, trust issues—not just with people, but with systems, authority figures, even family and friends. I’ve become impulsive, reckless at times. I used to be a sharp student. I used to dream of applying abroad. I wanted to go to LUMS. I even had my eyes on Japan’s MEXT scholarship.\nBut I couldn’t focus. I couldn’t think. I was just trying to survive day to day.\nAnd in the end, I failed—not because I wasn’t capable, but because I was destroyed before I could try.\n\nNow I’m at NUST. A good school. But every single day is a reminder that I ended up here not by choice, but because others ruined my future and walked away without even a slap on the wrist.\nMy family spent money, hope, and emotion trying to give me a future.\nWhat we got in return was trauma, silence, and shame.\n\nAnd every time I try to speak about it, I’m told to stop. That I’m “dwelling.”\nThat “it’s over.” That I should “move on.”\n\nBut how do you move on from something you never got closure for?\nHow do you move on from trauma when the system not only failed you—but protected the abusers?\n\nI don’t know if I’ll ever fully heal. I carry this with me every day.\nI post now, not for sympathy—but so people know.\nSo maybe someone else doesn’t end up like me.\nSo another child doesn’t think silence is the price of survival.\n\nThanks for reading. If you’ve ever been failed by a system that was supposed to protect you, you’re not alone.\n\nPHOTOS OF PERPETRATORS:\n\n1st photo: Manager Hostel Col Farooq  \n\n2nd: Another photo of him with some Officers (He's the one in the suit)  \n\n3rd: Hostel Warden: Askar Zaman  \n\n4th: A toxic roommate Haris Sikandar (He tore apart my books and notebooks, and also threw my clothes in a dustbin after breaking my cupboard)  \n\n5th: That Gilgiti who stole my airpods Azan Khaliq  \n\n6th: Another toxic roommate Arsalan Alam  \n\n7th: That senior who broke my cupboard and stole my stuff Malik Asjid Ilyas",

Yeh post likhna mere liye asaan nahi tha lekin ab itna stress barh gaya hai ke mujhe kisi platform par apni baat rakhni hi padh rahi hai.\n\nMain apna naam aur designation disclose nahi karna chahta, lekin main sirf itna kehna chahta hoon ke main rozana mental torture se guzar raha hoon. Na theek se sona ho raha hai, na family ke sath waqt guzar pa raha hoon.\n\nProblem ka centre ek hi shakhsiyat hain,  Rabia Ahmad, jo ke Director Admissions hain. Woh OFA aur NOP dono dekhti hain. Unka rawaiya itna toxic hai ke samajh nahi aata kya karun. Employees se badtameezi se baat karna, meetings mein Punjabi mein gandi zubaan use karna, meri chaye ke cups count karna, har waqt meri movement monitor karna, cross lying krna aur har choti baat pe zaleel karna unka routine hai. Yahan tak ke agar dispenser se paani bhi pee loon to gussa karti hain k yahan se paani na piyo.\n\nUnka style yeh hai ke kabhi kuch verbally keh deti hain aur baad mein kehti hain ke “maine to aisa kuch kaha hi nahi.” Jab koi important kaam ho ya baat karni ho, woh jaan bujh ke apna room band kar leti hain, aur phir delay ka ilzam mujhe pe dal deti hain.\n\nMain yeh sab bardasht karte karte thak gaya hoon. Jab main kisi aur department mein apply karta hoon, woh un departments mein call karke meri burai karti hain taake meri offer cancel ho jaye.\n\nMujhe HR se bhi dar lagta hai aur provost se bhi. Kisi pe bharosa nahi. Mere chotay bachay hain, mujhe job ka bhi darr hai. Magar meri mental health is had tak tabah ho chuki hai ke main depression ki dawat de raha hoon.\n\nYeh post main kisi badla lene ke liye nahi likh raha. Sirf yeh poochhna chahta hoon, main kya karun? Kya koi aisa tareeqa hai ke main kisi safe jagah par complaint lodge kar sakun ya kese awaaz uthaon?\n\nAgar aap kisi ne kabhi aisi situation handle ki ho, toh please madad karein. Main serious action lena chahta hoon lekin safe reh kar.\n\nMenay LUMS se ye expect nai kia tha.\n\nFloor ke aur employees bhi tang hain lekin koi awaaz nahi uthata kyun ke sabko apni rozi ka darr hai. Lekin ab bardasht se bahar hai.\n\nShukriya agar aap yahan tak parh sakein. Kisi bhi advice ya support ka intezar rahega.\n",

I've had huge losses in the past 2 years and this year after a gap I finally decided I wouldn't settle for average just because the odds were against me, lost my dad, completed fsc and started tutoring just so I could ease the financial burden on my family a bit, took mdcat but lost a govt seat by just 0.3% so for me life has never turned out my way. I always wanted to get into either lums or nust, nust net 1 ki 5k application fee was already a burden but I somehow managed by taking in 2 more students for tutoring, I thought lums ki would also be somewhere between 6 7k which i had already set aside and I also registered for lcat since sat would have been a huge burden for my family, turns out the application costs 11k w an additional 6k for lcat, ive already given up so many of my dreams after my dad just to save a single more rupee that could be of some use to my family, I have 4 siblings who are all younger to me and so I cannot be the one spending away everything when the income is already under 1 lac 50k a month in which the house rent, grocery expenses and other household expenses go, we hardly have 3 4k left by then end of the month, I hate how all the good unis in pakistan have set the application fee so high that a middle class kid dares not to even apply and try his luck",

        "body": "yaar dekho, writing a personal statement is NOT as scary as it seems. you do NOT have to pay **PKR 40,000** just for some \"professional\" agency to write your personal statement in the most impersonal way possible. you just need to understand the two key elements which makes a statement stand out.\n\n1. Your \"why\" (your core narrative, discussed in the first prompt)\n2. Your \"how\" (your ambitions and contribution to LUMS, discussed in the second prompt)\n\n**General tips for brainstorming and ideas**\n\n* Brainstorm karo, before mindlessly asking someone else to give you ideas or diving into AI. Answer the questions in a google doc, the ones i'll write under the prompts below. try to connect your ideas and see personally kesa lagta hai yeh major ya what truly does interest you\n* **\\[THIS IS JUST FOR BRAINSTORMING\\]** if you can't understand why you like THIS major, think about other majors which you are not applying to. what is something that is present in THIS major that is not in other majors? Like if u wanna study economics but don't know why, think about why you DO NOT want to study maths, physics, english, business etc\n   * For EACH unselected major, finish this sentence: \"I don't want to study \\[Major\\] because it lacks \\_\\_\\_??.\"\n   * Then you'll understand what truly does excite you about economics (or any major ur going for)\n* Write down and dump all your unfiltered thoughts onto a google doc, u can just write down features of ur major, dump down the courses in that major and somehow link your interests with those\n   * **EXTRA TIP:** notebookLM is a free feature google ka, in which u can  insert ur braindumping wala pdf or doc and it will create a mindmap for you based on that. this can help you link ideas together and visualize ur thought process.\n\n**Use the personal statement to tell us about your interest in the Major/Academic program you wish to study at LUMS.**\n\nThis is your WHY. Why do you want to study THIS? It sounds like a big question, so start answering smaller ones.\n\n* What was the first moment you felt curious about your field? \n* What inefficiency or injustice related to this field have you noticed in your daily life? - this is one of my favs cuz it shows u want to contribute something and actually have a solution-oriented mind, more tangible than just \"i like economics graphs\"\n* When you learn something new in this field, what part gives you satisfaction? for example, economics mein it would be understanding why inequality occurs in every aspect like unemployment etc. CS mein it could be when you learn the logic behind different algorithms BECAUSE you don't like just learning code for the sake of it etc etc. always link it with your own personal interests\n\n**TEMPLATE IDEA (each aspect should be 1 paragraph)**\n\n|ASPECT|DETAILS|SAMPLE SENTENCE|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Spark and interest**|A specific moment, observation, or experience that ignited your curiosity; Show, don't just tell - use a brief anecdote; Should be personal and authentic (not dramatic); Establishes your unique starting point|\"What drew me to political science was a simple question from my 10-year-old cousin: 'Why do some areas of Lahore get clean water while others don't?' I had no good answer, and that silence bothered me for weeks.\"|\n|**Aspects of the program and link to the story**|Connect your initial spark to specific elements of the major ;Show you understand what the field actually involves ;Mention 1-2 core concepts or methods you want to learn|\"My cousin's question uncovered my interest in resource allocation and public policy. I started reading and ruminating about municipal governance structures and how budget decisions are made.\"|\n|**Evolution, perspective and growth**|Show development from initial spark to deeper understanding; what did you DO about your interest? note, dont flex your ECAS thats in prompt 2 Include a challenge or learning moment (be honest about growth) Show how your thinking evolved|\"I interviewed our local councilor about water infrastructure. His answer about 'budget constraints' and 'historical pipeline layouts' showed me how practical limitations shape ideal policies|\n|**LINK to LUMS**|Mention professors, courses, centers, or opportunities by name and Explain HOW LUMS will help address your questions/continue your journey|MGHSS is exactly the space where I want to explore my questions like how urban governance in Punjab directly relates to the infrastructure issues I encountered, and I hope to contribute through the ...\"|\n\n**Discuss your ambitions, skills, and experience, and how they will help you succeed in your chosen Major/Academic program.**\n\nEasiest way to approach this is to divide it into 4 paragraphs, it is more straightforward than the previous prompt.\n\n* Ambitions (1st paragraph)\n   * What you want to learn (specify courses and topics)\n   * What you want to BECOME\n   * what you want to contribute to society and LUMS both\n* Skills  2nd pragraph (skills matlab what you are capable of doing, also link it to your potential which you wanna explore - can come in ambitions too)\n   * For example, data analysis is a skill, while working in a software house is an experience. you can use these together to make one experience-turned-skill point\n   * Write at least 3-4 skills which are needed in your major. YOU CAN also write unique and \"strange\" skills and link them to your major as it will catch the reader's attention\n* EXPERIENCES 3d paragraph (flex flex flex)\n   * ALL ECAS but do not just write any ECA WITHOUT talking about what it TAUGHT YOU, what it did to improve your interest in the major, and link it to a skill (preferably mentioned before)\n* blend it all together into a TYPE of learner (a personality type that will literally slay the program)\n   * If you choose economics, u can write \"as an inquisitive and analytical learner, my xyz skills experiences etc etc will shape the way i approach economics. analysis through my excel courses etc etc ensures i do well in econometrics, blended with my essay-writing skills.\"\n\nGOOD LUCK! if u need any help or hav any questions, lmk in the comments or DMS okay :3",

So if we were to calculate the Zakah which is 2.5% of your total wealth, its more than 1cr yearly (footnote-1). Man it requires guts to give this much to poor but remember, its nothing more than an obligation. You aren't doing any favor to those poor but following the word of Allah.\n\n>\n\nAnd do not let those who ˹greedily˺ withhold Allah’s bounties think it is good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed ˹by their necks˺ on the Day of Judgment with whatever ˹wealth˺ they used to withhold. And Allah is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. Quran 3:180\n\nThis is just for the sake of informing masses, maybe some of you are unaware of it. I'm being fully netural, not mocking the rich neither envying. Earn/expend as much as you want just don't waste (Quran 25:67) and be a practical MUSLIM! May Allah give us hidayah. Ik i'm going to trigger some peeps but hoping they'd understand the message, give zakah and alleviate the situation of our society.\n\n1: If invested, then their would be some return probably which may be enough for their material needs. So that the investment could be surplus, even if it isn't, then there's some margin i left which may go there.\n\n\n\nEdit: i really think i made a mistake by making this post 😭🙏 somehow i thought of giving 1cr in alms, it was little bit shocking for me so thought why not just share it, sort of how ppl are managing it.

            "Zakat also has restrictions. It's not applicable on net worth or assets. In general terms its only applicable on cash or cash investments and trade goods acquired during the zakat year. It's not applicable on jewellery (except hanafi doctrine), or gems or personal belongings including houses, land (it is applicable on crops grown on land), cars and many other types of wealth stores.\n\nSo it's entirely possible for a person to have an asset portfolio worth millions of PKR and low amount of cash in hand at the end of the zakat year, that they have to pay zakat on.\n\nIt's the same with tax. Tax is not applicable on speculated wealth (e.g. Elon Musk owns 200B worth of companies, why isn't he taxed on it!), only realised wealth that's actually in hand. If Elon Musk in the example were to actually sell off his shares in order to obtain that 200B in cash, he wouldn't actually be able to do that because when the market is flooded with all his shares,the purchase price will drop accordingly and the cash he's actually able to realise will be orders of magnitude less than his 'net worth' but we can't actually calculate what it would amount to, so he can't actually be taxed. He can and will be taxed on his salaries as CEO and dividends if there's any received but that's also just a fraction of his 'net worth'.",

During this, I realized I could automate this so that a program will login and check the portal for me, and show me just the information I needed to know at one glance. So here is that program! The instructions are given on the page, and if you have any concerns or are stuck on any step, do not hesitate to reach out to me on Discord which is ShaheerSarfaraz#1532. Good Luck and Godspeed!

        "body": "Greetings all, I hope you all are doing well. LUMS admission for the Fall of 2026 has begun. With everyone pacing to gather their documents to fulfil the requirements, including meeting the academic expectations to match the surged competition, I’m here to guide you all with one of the most important yet overlooked aspects of the application, which is the Personal Statement. Undoubtedly, grades and SAT matter the most, but having a stellar Personal Statement gives you the edge over other applicants to give an insight into your life to persuade the admission officer that you are the most deserving in the sea of thousands of applicants by expressing your interest, ambitions and skills for the desired major.\n\nTherefore, I’ll be making 7 posts over the period of time till the deadline to reach the maximum number of students. Since I noticed that several of you miss the opportunity to get samples that can aid them in creating the most impactful and convincing Personal Statement they can. Now you may wonder, considering the trend of my previous application posting from a collective of 3 posts, to moving up to 7. Quite honestly, I don’t know the scientific reasoning behind the significance of 7, but God created the universe in a total of 7 days, in which he rested on the seventh day. We revolve around the holy Kaaba during the Pilgrimage for 7 rounds. God created the 7 skies up to heaven, and the mention of the 7 deadly sins in the Christian doctrine. That's why I’ll be making 7 posts, each talking about a certain aspect of the admission process, while offering free samples.\n\n**Therefore, for those who need free samples of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 applicants who got accepted into their respective schools. Feel free to reach out. Or you can also comment below, and I will reach out to you as soon as possible.**",

Stare back at them with such a threatening face that you will kill them, they wont dare to look at you and hopefully also learn a lesson. don't you become a sheep to get eaten by wolves. Also carry some form of self defense like a pocket knife or pepper spray(bear spray is way better but not available in Pak ). If you move like I do, a 9mil is the way to roll, but I still keep a folding knife on me. Have beaten the f\\*\\*\\* out of many boys for this very reason and once an uncle(around 50 y old) who used to stare and always throwing off creepy gestures to our female fellows and teachers outside the college gate.

I don't know what major you are but I graduated and started job a few months ago and I think that atleast my office has a nice environment for women to work. I am a guy so this is mostly observation based. If you end up at some grad school or nice well reputed company you will find mostly nice people, like the ones who know ke if you want to reach out to someone staring is the last thing to do.\nAs someone said before too, try to make it look like you didn't notice the stare and never ever try to stare back, plz, guys think it is a reciprocation. Inside lums, some staff might just be figuring out if they have seen you before cause I sometimes felt stares too but mostly it's the old uncles who really might not be creepy but don't know ke staring is considered creepy, plus I doubt that even the uni administration can do anything to change about how those uncles have lived their whole life.\nLastly, people were saying about clothes, and I think everyone should already know ke not very peoppe will be going to grocery as going to some fashion show😭.\nAnd there have been instances of girls in burqa even getting stared. So good luck and I hope you don't have any bad experiences like this ever again.",

There was no arrangement of water or food so quite literally starved from 8-2. The same glass was being used by everyone in the hall which is just disgusting. There was only ONE clock in the hall at the front which was so small that even the front row candidates wouldn’t have been able to see it. Time management is crucial for any paper and they would only inform us of time 5 mins before the section ending. Management tou buri thi but the paper even beat that. They mentioned on their website sample paper that it’s similar to SAT but not one topic came it was majorly based on logical reasoning and IQ which requires a lot of time. Highly disappointed.",

            "We wouldn’t have complained if they had simply mentioned that 50% of the math section would be logical reasoning instead of officially stating on the website that it would be a carbon copy of the SAT. We understand if they wanted to make grading and selection tougher, but introducing completely unfamiliar question types negatively impacted even the topics we had studied. This level of unfairness was unexpected, especially since LCAT has always been much easier and more basic than the SAT in previous years. Including FSC-level math, despite knowing that students from medical backgrounds are also taking the test, was terrible.",
            "yeah i was at the islamabad hotel too. Purely insane how they treated the students. Literally had to stand in a row for straight 2 hours just to enter the exam hall and then the paper was complete different then the sample paper as well as the sat.",

Don't get scammed.",
            "I studied from him as well, back in 2015, when he used to teach in his academy in Model Town. To be honest, it was a waste of money, and I, at the end of the day, did the preparation all on my own. His explanation for maths questions didn't make sense, and I remember correctly that there was this question which meant something else, and he thought of something else and said that it should be done this way while I questioned him about it. He thought I was joking with him by asking why, and he dismissed the concern.",
            "There is a lot of hate going on for tutoria on a few posts in Reddit and we wanted to address it officially. There are two sides to every coin. So let’s address the grievances of certain individuals on the platform.\n\nQ. Tutoria only has practice questions from khan academy, and college board. There are only 2-5 full length exams.  \nA. Tutoria has over 7000+ questions, while khan academy recycles the same (roughly 1000) questions. College board itself doesn’t come close. We spend tens of thousands of dollars building our question bank. If a student themselves went on to acquire the same question bank it would cost them upwards of at least 1000 dollars.\n\nAlso, we offer 13 full length ADAPTIVE exams as of now and we are adding more. We are the only prep platform in Pakistan with the adaptive exam engine that mimics the actual exam 100%, allowing students to remove uncertainties from exam day and making the actual exam all that less scary.\n\n \n\nQ. Students can get a good score through self study as well.\n\nA. There is no doubt or disagreement here. We encourage students to, if they can, conduct self studies for the exam prep. Our platform is there to help them. Student can self study, then take the 1 day free trial from our platform and attempt the full length exams to see how effective they were. BUT there is a small caveat, this does not mean that every student can self study. Just like in school, some students get good grades without tuition while other need extra help. Saying every student can get a good grade without help is misleading and a disservice to those that do need it. Wasting their time and money.\n\n \n\nQ. There’s only 2 classes a week.\n\nA. There are 5 classes every week for 8 weeks, plus a full-length exam on the sixth day. Over the course of the program, students engage for more than 90 hours, not counting additional discussion sessions and one-on-one query support available on the platform.\n\n \n\nQ. Khan Academy has everything, you do not need tutoria\n\nA. Khan Academy does not even come close to Tutoria when it comes to SAT. No live classes, no TA help, no analytics on weak areas. There is no comparison. Again, do not take our word for it. Try khan academy and then take the trial for our platform free of charge. Decide for yourself.\n\n \n\nQ. Tutoria only shows state toppers in there ads. And they are the same few people.  \nA. This is a bit confusing. Why would state toppers need tutoria when they are already intelligent enough to get a top score? This reflects cognitive dissonance. We are proud of improving scores for hard working students by atleast 200 points on average, and these videos show that. Then they are so pleased that they give us a raving video review. And there aren’t just few. There are many from just the past few months.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDk1NjAyMTgzNzk1NDc5?igsh=MWpjcTNvdmdkd3ExcA==](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDk1NjAyMTgzNzk1NDc5?igsh=MWpjcTNvdmdkd3ExcA==)",

            "Before everyone starts saying it’s a paid comment or whatever hear me out. You have to make your own decisions and then take accountability for them. No one forced you to take his course. It’s just like how you have free Zainematics content on YouTube for math, but some students still choose to take his paid past paper sessions because it gives structure and direction. Personally, I found his portal really helpful it gave me discipline and a proper study plan. Self-studying usually makes me lose focus, so having that structure helped. There’s honestly nothing fraud about it lol. He’s doing exactly what he promised teaching, taking classes, providing a well organized portal, and offering TA sessions. So if you didn’t get the score even after doing 5000 problems… that sounds more like a *you* problem than his..",

It's worth noting that no resource alone guarantees success—it depends on how well it aligns with your preparation strategy and how you use it. For me, it worked brilliantly.

        "body": "Hi guys, I saw a post of someone sharing their story of not getting into LUMS. I have a similar story and seeing their post gives me the courage to post it.  \nI dreamt of getting into LUMS during my O levels, got 5A\\*s & 4As, and in As I got 3As and 1B. I had splendid ecas intl' and national too, since April 15th, 2023 I checked my portal almost 10 times a day, I joined acceptance groups as well as this sub reddit, saw people with similar credentials getting in and in the meantime I received my SAT score, unfortunately it was almost touching the bar (1320) just 30 short of 1350, I spend my whole CAIE prep time in this anxiety of getting in while my friends with lower credentials got in and some with equal credentials too, I messed up my CAIEs a bit in this tension. Fast forward to 21st July when I was about to leave for theater to watch Oppenheimer with a friend who got into LUMS, I checked my admission portal and saw the admission tab, when i opened it I saw the rejection letter. My Life turned upside down for a moment. Couldn't breath properly drank a glass of water, I was with my friend so I just went with him to the movies. Came back home and my family knew because my dad had my admission portal credentials. Then came my result day, received AABC in my A levels and then I joined IBA. I spend my first month at IBA in depression, didnt like anything at all but slowly i started researching IBA alumni on linkedin and found out the prestige IBA holds matches that of LUMS with some pros and cons on each side. Fast forward a year, I am a sophomore at IBA and a proud member of the dean's honor list, ik it comes with no benefits but still is a recognition, and when i look at my friends who went to LUMS, I see myself better off because in my freshmen year i landed an Internship at PwC, I have bigger aspirations as compared to them and the friends that I have at IBA are very ambitious always acquiring skills to crack into Wall Street Investment banking.\n\nAt the end, I'd suggest everyone that life doesnt always go your way, but that doesnt mean that you'll be left behind, continue grinding and eventually you get the reward of your hard work. LUMS is definitely worthy but if you dont get in then dont lose hope life doesn't end here !",

Having a Lums degree would be equivalent to having a degree from any other college. Wouldn't matter. \n\nA bachelors degree is a baby degree. The masters degree is what really matters so make sure to get that abroad. Meanwhile I reccomend you apply to LSE. It's the best alternative to Lums and has primarily the same management. It's a well reputed university in Pakistan and it'll be cheaper as well. The teachers there are great as well.\n\nGood luck",

So, have an honest chat with them, and explain how you feel. They might surprise you and be more supportive than you think!\n\nNow, about that gap year... it's not the end of the world! You can use this time to explore your passions, volunteer, or even take online courses to boost your skills. Who knows, you might discover a new talent or interest!\n\nAnd hey, FAST Islamabad isn't a bad deal at all! Their Accounting and Finance program is solid, and it's still a great opportunity. Maybe have another chat with your dad, and share your perspective. He might reconsider his thoughts.\n\nLastly, don't even think about harming yourself, okay?

        "body": "Dear applicants. I hope you all are doing well. The LUMS admission process has reached its most significant duration period, which I call The Crossing. In the continuation of my posts through the LUMS admission process for fall 2025, the crossing or the month of December is the most critical of all because, by this time, things get at high stakes. As the nerves start kicking in, those who slightly doubted themselves for not making it to LUMS are now doubting even more as the deadline approaches nearer and nearer, for those who have received their SAT score in the recent series and didn't get the desired outcome might be afraid of not being good enough, some of you might even get the biggest existential crises of your life where you question what's the point of all this, and then there are those too who know they can make no matter what but need a little push.\n\nLife is a constant battle against circumstances, and your path to any university is just another place in your journey of life. The reason why I called this post the crossing is because, like a tightrope walker who is staking his life on the line in the lapse of 3 minutes, you all applicants are staking your future in the duration of the upcoming 2 months. Although the consequences in comparison to a tightrope walker aren’t absolute death but, underneath the crossing lies all your hopes for a better life, job security, societal image of yourself, family expectations, and unreached potential. \n\nTherefore, to help you in this journey to cross to the next phase of your life, I’m offering the little help that I can. I am not an expert in anything. I can't get you admitted into LUMS or give you a secret tip to ace your SAT/LCAT or academic credentials. But what I can do is share my experience and insights into the field that i have most acquainted myself with in the entire university admission process, and that is the Personal Statements.\n\n **So for those who need Personal Statement Samples for previously accepted applicants (2022, 2023, and 2024), feel free to reach out or comment down below, and I’ll reach out to you myself.** ",

        "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm an International female student (F1 visa) from Pakistan and a 1st-semester student in the Computer Science with Honors Program in the US.\n\nI have earned a total of 20 credits this semester, 14 credit hours taken this semester and 3+3 transfer credits from SAT.\n\nI have many extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and certifications in Pakistan as a High Schooler and here in the US as well, especially concerning technology and CS.\n\nBack in High School, I did an FSc in pre-engineering from Army Schools and Colleges with good marks/GPA i.e 88% on the Pakistani grading scale and +3.5 on the US grading scale. I also took the SAT with 1400 marks in Dec 2023.\n\nReason to transfer: I applied to the US with all my blood, sweat, and tears, and with the grace of Allah SWT, I got admission to my university with 75% to 80% of the full-ride scholarship, which included my tuition, housing and meal, and a MacBook laptop based on my High School (11th-12th grade) GPA and SAT. Everything had been going well so far until I realized my parents could not afford the remaining fee in dollars i.e. $3500 to $4000 (10 lakhs to 15 lakhs approx.) per semester in this deteriorating economy of Pakistan. I cannot compromise my studies and squander my time by attending a cheaper community college in the US and then starting my degree. I understand that it may not be a wise decision to return to Pakistan while everyone is dying to go abroad, but I am insinuating giving in to my financial crisis. I feel I may go after my undergraduate degree as I already earned a US visa for 5 years, and it is perhaps easy peasy to go again for Master's/PhD study.\n\nTransfer to LUMS: I decided to do my transfer to LUMS with a scholarship/financial aid. I emailed them since I have a unique case of transferring as a Pakistani student there. I didn't receive a \"tasalli bakhsh jawaab\" from them, so I am posting my query here. Is it possible to transfer to LUMS based on my situation above? Plus, they asked to take the LCAT, which I saw while filling out the application form and realized was not possible while living in the US. So, will they accept SAT instead?\n\nWould appreciate your discussion and guidance on this.",

            "Stay in US and maybe find a part time job at a local fast food chain, like seriously. If finances are the only issue apply for a student loan, its very likely to get approved as you are already in US and once you complete your education and get a proper job you can easily pay it off in next few years. Take it in a friendly tone that there is no future here in Pakistan. Build your career there and might sound stereotypical, but it's mostly true that when  women in pakistan fail they are trapped in instant marriage. You have an opportunity many people don't, squeeze through these few years and you can not only establish a life for yourself but also your parents.",
            "F1 visa is based on the university you go to. If you leave your current university, F1 visa will be finished and you will probably have to apply again if you want to go back to US for studies again.",
            "Just to gives you a glimpse.\nLUMS give financial aid to really needy like they ask for your home pictures, all details. And usually give to extremely poor people.\n\nFor scholarship… seeing your sat and matric grades… it is impossible (nearly)… as you would get 50% tuition fee off on overall profile but those with 1520-1550+…. \n\nLastly LUMS fee is also 16-17 lakh per year / 8-9 lakh per semester…\n\nSo choose wisely. If you take my opinion I don’t think you would qualify for either financial aid or scholarship (bcz these are just avg. grades for a LUMS student) so please get a confirmed offer before leaving US… other than that hope for the best… and you can consider taking loan in US I know we Pakistanis don’t like that but most Indians do that….",

            "Once you come back, it will be difficult for you to go back in regards to extending your visa as your poor financial conditions in the past will be a red flag for the VO. Try to get a job and manage your expenses there.",

            "Find a Pakistani American and get married. It's taking me around 3 years to bring my wife on i130. If she had a student visa that would be amazing.",
            "I know this sounds hard, but please dont do your ug from pk once you are there, its going to reflect badly once you graduate as well! esp if you want to get a scholarship for your masters in the US. I wish there was something I could do to help you, I really hope your problems go away",
            "As you are a CS student, the best advice i can give is to hunt for related roles under OPT or CPT. These roles are usually high paying so hopefully they'll get you covered.",
            "It's extremely difficult to get scholarship or financial aid from lums. Since you have a CS background look into designing websites or some sort of online freelancing. A lot of startups are looking for it. I don't think it's a reasonable decision to come back here considering you'd have to most likely pay the full fees as well as hostel accommodation fees, pay for food etc. it'll be a bigger strain on you financially",
            "$4,000 per semester is really cheap by US standards for an international student. I would highly encourage you to take a loan. Since you are doing computer science, you will get 3 years after your graduation to find a job on OPT. If you work on your skills, you should have a job within 6 months and would pay your loan within those 3 years easily.\n\nI know Pakistanis who took loans and repaid their loans after graduation. Now, they are American citizens and have earned a crazy amount of money. They also did computer science like you. They also went to community college and were worried about wasting their year. But, in the end, it didn't matter.\n\nFor example, let's say, you graduate at 24 and earn $60,000 per year in a city with low expenses. Your salary will increase over time and you would save enough $ to buy cheap Pakistani properties, help your parents/family, and retire early. Your Pakistani friends graduate at 22-23 and earn a salary of 50,000 to 1 lakh per month. It would take them decades to buy a house. You would able to do the things in your 20s that they can't even do in their 40s or even 50s. Also, I don't know if it matters to you, but it would also help you to choose who you marry -- unlike most Pakistani girls. \n\nPlease don't return to Pakistan. It's a hell. No matter which political party wins, we are at least 50 years away from decent enough development.\n\nJust focus on your skills, pick a good niche, and get some good internships after 2nd year.",
            "Stay in the US. I would suggest considering a loan and paying it off over time. While the job market in the US is currently challenging, there is still significant hiring happening for SWE roles. Returning home may not be the best long-term decision. I graduated from LUMS and later moved to the US for my graduate degree. After completing my studies, I was able to secure a role.\n\nMake sure to secure an interesting internship every summer, as this will be crucial. Focus on networking and seeking out the right opportunities for summer internships. You can also consider a co-op semester, which can help cover your expenses and even allow you to pay off part of your loans or fees.\n\nThe journey ahead may be tough, but it’s not impossible. As an international student, I’ve experienced these challenges firsthand, and I can assure you that things do work out. While I didn’t take out a loan myself, I know others who did and were able to pay it off with minimum payments within 3-4 years, depending on the loan amount.",
            "I have read your concerns and the challenges you're facing in the US as a student. I hope everything goes well for you. I would like to recommend considering countries in Europe such as Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. These countries not only accept credit transfers but are also cost-effective options. Additionally, you would receive a Schengen visa, which allows you to work part-time while studying.\n\nAfter completing your studies, you can apply for a Post-Study Work (PSW) visa for 1 year to 18 months. This visa permits you to explore job opportunities across all Schengen countries without any strings attached.\n\nOf course, there are pros and cons. One of the challenges you might face is the language barrier. However, many universities offer programs to help you learn the local language, and the benefits of doing so are significant. With proficiency in the language, you could obtain permanent residency (PR) and eventually be eligible to apply for citizenship.\n\nI hope everything works out for you, and remember not to lose hope—things will get better, Insha Allah!"

        "body": "A fellow first-batch acceptance here! That's been a helluva rollercoaster ride since April 19, if I look back. I didn't care about my lums acceptance initially because, let's be honest, I knew I wouldn't be able to afford it. I kept my focus on preparing for NUST; I had given all my hopes of securing aid because, in April, May, June, and mid-July, I didn't get to hear back from the fin aid department regarding any positive developments of my aid case. But, deep in my heart, I somehow kept praying to Allah for making it easier to get into LUMS. In reality, it seemed impossible for me to attend Lums, and the aid scene seemed out of equation. Last nail in the coffin was seeing my friends get rejected for aid. 7 out of 10 students at my school applied for aid; 6 of them got rejected. I was waiting to be the 7th rejected one\n\nHowever, while traveling by bus from Lahore to Islo for the NUST entry test, I received an email on my phone. Upon opening my portal, I discovered 40% aid, which, while not substantial, was still better than nothing. The aid decision came after a wait of 77 days: countless emails, verification calls, documentation requests, etc.\n\nSoon I was thinking, \"LAHORE (HOME) CALLING ME BACK, C'MON BOY, IT IS HAPPENING!\" I approached the examination with a sense of serenity; the rain felt good, the breezy wind was truly marvelous that day, and the exam proceeded smoothly. I took the very next bus to Lahore, and believe me, I've never felt so excited about returning home.\n\nIgnore my messed-up grammatical expressions in this post, but I just wanted to tell this story to all my dear sisters and brothers in this sub-reddit who are still awaiting their LUMS decision: If your LUMS decision is still pending, don't worry. Allah pe tawakkul hoga tou wo tumhein NUST kay main gate us bhi utha kar wapis LUMS le ayega. Keep praying; in fact,  I'll be praying for you guys too. 8 days are still left. I've seen how sincere duas can change your fortune. I know how anxious you guys are (I was even more anxious than you guys), but it will only impact your mental health. My brothers and sisters are awaiting their decisions; remember, YOU guys are precious. Don't overburden your mental and physical health by worrying about the decision. I firmly believe you did your best.\n\nThe time you spent writing those personal statements, the hard work you put into doing your LCAT/SAT/academic grades, and the sweat you shed doing LUMS documents (esp. fin aid), your efforts will soon pay off. My DM is always open if you need any advice. Keep me updated, my fellas, and I look forward to hearing positive news from you all. This random reddit stranger believes in YOU.\n\nEdit: also pray for me. My alevels result is coming on 13th august. Pray that my result come within lums grade requirement (I'm worrying) 😭",

Most day scholars end up getting a room anyway, even if they don’t stay every night, just to have access to everything. There’s no curfew, and you can order food anytime without any hassle. The rooms are decent, the storage space is enough, and you can even keep a mini fridge.\n\nThe only real drawback is that there’s no AC in the rooms, but you can always sleep in the common room during peak summer days. And honestly, it’s just 2–3 hot months, most of the summer is spent at home anyway.\n\nHostel life at LUMS is unmatched. The hangouts, the late-night chai runs, the random deep conversations—it’s all unforgettable. Laundry services could use some improvement, but that’s not a dealbreaker. The communal kitchens and washrooms are pretty okay too. Washrooms are cleaned twice a day, and it really comes down to how considerate your wingmates are.",

        "body": "I am from Kasur, and I applied to LUMS for Computer Science and Business School. I am a student at KIPS College. Out of the four girls from my city who applied, two were from pre-medical, one from pre-engineering, and one from ICS. Among us, I had the highest SAT score and overall extracurricular achievements. In 2021, I was awarded \"Brain of Kasur,\" which was a district award for the best student in the district. Similarly, I have received many other awards, and my academics were also very strong.\n\nDespite having an excellent SAT score, three of the girls were rejected, and one girl, who was unknown to us and came from a different background, was accepted by LUMS. Even though she has no notable extracurricular activities, and I have verified her application and found discrepancies, including the \"Brain of Kasur\" award which I originally received, she managed to get in. I was shocked to see her application filled with fake activities and awards.\n\nI want to ask if this is fair to students. It seems that the college has supported her by creating fake achievements and awards. Even her personal statement is not written by her. It feels like she got in through connections and fake credentials. I believe this is very wrong.\n\nWe often say that LUMS has strict criteria, but this shows that you can get in by creating fake documents and using connections. It feels like no matter how hard we work; it doesn't count if we don't have connections or fabricate our achievements.\n\nWhat to do now where to complain?",

            "Hey!! Why do you care if anyone thinks about you in your absence or not. Just focus on building yourself. I know it can be a bit overwhelming seeing people around you socializing and enjoying themselves when you also desire that for yourself; we have all been there. \nBut know that most of them have known each other from there time in school together while you are just getting started.\nTry to join many societies, don't just try for the big names. Go for smaller societies too. They are the closest knitted ones of them all. Rooting for you.\nFeel free to reach out if things get too hard.",

            "Don't worryy. I have recently come to LUMS as well and I can think about nothing other than my previous friends even tho a lot of people here are very nice to me. I don't understand Phy 101 either 😭. And don't worry about how you look. Trust me you see way more defect in your appearance than other people do. Inshallah it will get better. And it's ok me and alot of other people probably feel the same way as you, it's not being ungrateful, it will just take some time for you to adjust.",

            "Hey, I had 2A\\*s 8As in my olvels, 1A\\* and 2As in my alvels, with a 1340 SAT score, i was also rejected by LUMS, and was very disheartened, throughout my o alevels, LUMS was the only place i wanted to go, and was for sure id make it, but i did not, and it felt like everything is over for me. I had to go to IBA, a uni i never had on my list, 4 years later, I am done with my bacehleors with a very high cgpa, i gave myself a lot of time during these 4 eyars which really helped me grow as an individual and i left the uni with a huge skill set. I am working in a very well structured organization, and am thriving there, i see around and i am doing way better than all my friends that went to lums/nust/giki or anyother top pakistani uni. When i received my rejection, i felt hopeless and had no direction in life, all the 4 years of o and alevels I had been building up for LUMS, but honestly Allah is the best of planners and you have no clue what He has planned for you. Keep working hard, be honest with yourself, and trust in what Allah has planned for you. Have contentment within you, and you will do great! side note: i made some of my bestest memories in IBA, my old friends from school/college reunited and we made a group that is still intact, some of the most amazing ppl i have seen, and lastly i met the love of my life there, and we are now together, so take all of this as a sign, ignore the pancreas ignroe the randoms, look at yourslef and keep trusting, all will be good soon!",

I feel you rn I got rejected from 21 universities but here is the deal all these universiies are somewhat biased and LUMS isn't even completely holistic as we have seen many times.

            "If you can’t afford for lums then you will be most likely considered for FA. Now listen, you just can’t expect to get a 100%, that us for those with very specific conditions like those having a single parent or their guardian having some medical conditions. But you can expect to get some waiver along with some student loan and the rest 30-40% you will pay. The remaining will be divided into loan and waiver. If you are genuine with your application and you really just can’t afford lums then definitely you will get in.",
            "Been there. I’m currently in my senior year, and I know how this dilemma goes. I applied for financial aid but got rejected, yet it was my parents’ dream for me to go to LUMS, and somehow things worked out. Even with the fee increase every year, we still managed.                 I will say this though: if you’re in a position where your parents would have to take loans or sell jewelry to afford your fees, then don’t go for it. I know a lot of people whose parents did that, and it becomes extremely stressful for everyone in the family.                                                 Otherwise, listen to your gut, things have a way of working themselves out",
            "The reason why I couldnt apply despite having the grades and the ECs :(\nI also have a sibling attending university at exactly the same time as me. So my parents have to bear twice the cost at the same time ( even if he's not at LUMS, they still have to pay his fees wherever he is)\nI dont think lums recognizes this either. So yeah im literally in my last safety option I never thought itd come to. Its horrible and the environment is horrible and it sucks because then I wonder what I did all of the studies and ECs for. Because someone who's done none of this and just given an entry test with horrible grades and No ecs is sitting next to me. \nIt all comes down to money at the end of the day. All this work hard stuff is just bs",
            "😭💔 bro they should give scholarships to people like us who aren't that rich to afford their fees",
            "🤝BTW what's your plan? \nWill you be applying for FA ?",

            "I got admitted into SSE this year, without giving SAT. Just based on LCAT. You can estimate from it mannn. Don't mind, but plzzz stop comparing yourselves, those who are posting here will only make 2-3% of applicant pool. Even if they are 10-15% (which is certainly not true), it will not make any significant difference, since alot of people applying with mid to lower credentials will not be active on reddit. Even very few of us know about this platform. I was exactly in the similar position last year!! Hearing about high credentials used to make me realize that I am not capable enough to secure admission. But if it is written from Allah, no one can hinder your path, just believe on yourself. Personally I am telling, I have seen people with 1270 score (but appeared for LcAT as well) secured admission. Don't discourage yourself. My only suggestion would be to use this platform for seeking guidance and to know about general stuff that what is situation. But don't pressurize yourself, if you are someone who overthink, I would suggest to leave reddit, prepare for LCAT/SAT, perform extraordinary, your acceptance will be on the door InshaAllah. One more thing, LUMS is not the end of world, even being a student, I only consider it as a normal university. Although, getting admission in a good reputable university makes your life journey little bit easier but it only increase chances, not guaranteed at the end of the day. Ignore English, I am writing this while having lunch. Sorry!!",

            "rankings like qs are solely based on research output (which btw only post grad students take part in usually), they don't weigh factors like faculty, social life, networking and other stuff. so sure, if you really think a university like nust is better if they pump out more research papers annually than lums, then u do u.\n\nalthough i would say nust is way better on the value side of things; it's fees is like a third of lums and the social life + faculty isn't too bad, if i lived in islamabad i wouldn't have given a second thought about going to nust ngl.",
            "You stated truth. Let me add more. Out of 276 faculty members at LUMS, more than 210 are Post Doctoral researchers and more than 110 are Ivy League PhDs. Every professor at LUMS is mandated to lead a research lab. LUMS overall has more than 85 research labs. Not including student labs. I'm not exaggerating and even students from notable universities like NUST and UET mainly and many medical doctors( FCPS ones even two of my Aunts researched and then moved for MD to US) like from KEMU, AIMC and FMU have been using LUMS Research Labs and equipments that are only available in one and only university in Pakistan. LUMS is reported to have funds of billions of rupees annually (around 5-7) and even more to accommodate the financial aid and NOP program, the biggest scholarship in Pakistan. LUMS approach of interdisciplinary sciences and free electives is motivated by Harvard and is referred to as \"Mini-Harvard of Pakistan\". Though you may disagree with this point. Even it has flaws and every university has, but undoubtedly it's a gift to Pakistani students who can't afford to study for bachelor's abroad. \nAlso LUMS professors are one of the most competent ones in Pakistan. Take Dr Zubair Khalid, the winner of Nobel Prize of Super-computing or Gordon Bell Prize, Dr Adam Zaman, Dr Tariq. They are esteemed people. I agree with you for their expensive fee structure, it's a necessity for them too to accommodate such nice people in Pakistan. \nBTW I read one of the comments, is Habib University really good? Do you suggest applying there apart from LUMS, NUST and GIKI?",

        "body": "1) LUMS does not care about your ECs. Almost everywhere I see students stressing on their ECs and wasting their time doing irrelevant co curricular activities at the expense of their academics. Don’t get me wrong, extra curricular are still important but if your goal is solely to get into LUMS you are 100% better off spending that extra energy on your academics instead.\n\n2) SAT SAT SAT! Many may not notice but SAT is definitely one of the most important aspects which LUMS sees if not THE MOST important (alongside O Levels). Your goal should be to put all your time and effort to ace the Sat and get a high score. Best time to give the SAT is the summers before the admission cycle, so for students applying for fall 2025, it would be the AUGUST Sat of 2024. \nEven if you do not get a good score you can still easily attempt in October, November and December without CAIE stress. \n\n3) AIM HIGH. If you have Cs and Bs in O levels, retake them to the point where you have at least 7 As/A*s. For the SAT, study smarter not harder. A 1400+ score is easily manageable with 1 months of prep.\n\n4) Lastly what I would like to say is do not rely on the LCAT, it is not standardised. \n\nFinal verdict: Just focus on your studies. Its LUMS, not harvard. They will just see your grades. Nothing is more important than that",

Such things push LUMS back in the rankings.\n\nHowever, LUMS does give you a tag that will take you way ahead in the corporate race than many other universities. There are companies that exclusively hire from LUMS (not even IBA). These include some of the top consultancies and MNCs of the world. Plus, with the LUMS tag you get a higher starting salary that graduates of other universities don't get.\n\nThe corporate side aside, in academia also LUMS gives you a massive edge. A lot of LUMS graduates are able to directly secure PhD admissions in top programmes right after graduation. Grants are also readily available for LUMS people due to the great networking it does in the academic circles. \n\nLUMS also gives you a great enabling environment to discuss and nurture your ideas.

Rankings don’t matter for Pakistan’s context, but LUMS provides unparalleled opportunity. \nYou won’t get a better business, humanities, law or liberal arts education anywhere else in Pakistan. The science school is open to debate, but for the rest there is definitely no comparable option.\nThe evidence of this is seen not through rankings but through the fact that from Pakistan, LUMS is overrepresented in prestigious graduate schools, the Fulbright, job market etc. There’s a very strong and established pipeline. Yes, all universities have wonderful, bright students who deserve amazing things, and getting into LUMS is just the start of the game you still have to work hard. \nBut there are undeniable privileges you get as a LUMS grad which you will only fully understand once you attend.",

            "Okay bachon EE senior here. Jo questions hon, ask ahead. \nYou’ll be taught courses from every stream. Instructors are great across the board for SSE. Some are harsher than others but everyone is so so knowledgeable. Cannot stress this enough, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OFFICE HOURS (don’t ask me what this is lums ao ge sub pata chal jaye ga). \nThere’s no such thing as homework bachon barhe ho jao. You get assignments. Some can be done in 10 minutes others can end up taking days (*cough cough* EE labs). \nSelf study is the only way at university. Don’t fall into the trap of group studies. Sub scam hai. You’ll either end up with someone really cunning who’ll skip most things and cover them themselves to eliminate the competition (you), or a dum f*ck who’ll drag you down with them because they won’t understand anything and won’t let you either. \nYou’ll hear shit like mean barha diya ya gira diya. Ignore that. I’ve literally never looked at the mean. Koi farq nahin parta. Focus on your own grades. \nNo past papers officially but seniors se bana ke rakhna. They can give them to you. For the love of god don’t tell people who shared the resources with you and don’t go announcing that you have them either. DC lag jaye gi, tumhein bhi aur senior ko bhi. \nExams ka koi structure nahin hota. Every instructor has their own way of testing. If you know the content and paid attention in class and to the book (each instructor has a book that they salivate over find out what that iss by *drum roll* visiting them in their office hours) you’ll breeze through most courses. \n\nMost importantly, FOCUS IN YOUR FIRST YEAR. Jaahil loug kahein ge GPA doesn’t matter rn but freshman mein it’s easiest to get a good GPA and a good GPA (anything above 3.4) can sustain hits in the next few years. \n\nYou WILL struggle. You could be the smartest person in the room (you’re not. Trust me. I’ve seen people with 140+ IQs struggle to manage things), but the sheer weight of the amount of work assigned will end up getting to you. Don’t put things off for the last few days (notice how I didn’t say last day). Don’t share your assignments. Let people call you a snake. Help people understand stuff but not in the time you’re studying. Your priority needs to be you. End mein koi kisi ka hain hota. Find friends outside SSE or all you’ll end up discussing is course work and how annoying a certain instructor is.",

        "title": "Rejected from LUMS – not my dream, but it still stings a little",
        "body": "So I got rejected from LUMS after the interview. And honestly, while it wasn’t my dream university, there’s this strange uneasiness in my heart that I can’t ignore. That’s why I wanted to share my story before I delete Reddit. (I only joined to get info on LUMS anyway.)\n\nTo be very honest, I never even put effort into my LUMS application. I didn’t take their entrance test. I chose the ACT route and I knew my score was average. From what I’ve heard, LUMS barely considers applicants below a certain score, so fair enough. But my academic profile has always been strong. I’m a pre-med student and I’ve always done well in that regard. Still, LUMS was never part of the plan.\n\nThe only reason I applied was because a close friend of mine was planning to. I thought maybe we’d get to spend just a semester together before I went off to medical college. But she didn’t apply in the end, and I was the one who did.\n\nWhen I got shortlisted for the interview, I was honestly surprised. I didn’t even know LUMS conducted interviews. If I had known, I might not have applied. I’ve always avoided situations where I felt I might get rejected. But this time, I didn’t run. I showed up.\n\nThen something happened right before the interview. It was so small but it shook me deeply. I walked in completely thrown off. I tried to answer their questions, but my head wasn’t there. I wasn’t present. Afterward, I cried the whole day. It felt like all my effort, all my potential, everything I believed I had, just came crashing down in those few minutes.\n\nLater I talked to a friend. I told her what had happened and how it affected me. She said something I’ll always remember: face what triggers you until it doesn’t trigger you anymore.\n\nThat one line changed so much for me. That interview didn’t go well, but it ended up humbling me in a way I didn’t expect. I’ve always been confident in my academics, and I still am, but now I see my weaknesses too. And more importantly, I’ve stopped running from them.\n\nBefore the interview, I told myself that if it went well, it would build my confidence, and if it didn’t, it would break it. But what actually happened was something I didn’t see coming. It rebuilt my confidence from within. Not because I got accepted. But because I faced something I used to avoid. And I grew.\n\nYes, I got rejected. And yes, that uneasiness still lingers a little. But now I know that my worth doesn’t come from a university rejection. It comes from what Allah has planned for me. And if this door didn’t open, I know there’s a better one ahead.\n\nSo this is me closing this chapter on my own terms.\n\nWishing everyone who’s starting their journey at LUMS all the best. May it bring you everything you’re hoping for and more.\n\nTake care.",

I feel you rn I got rejected from 21 universities but here is the deal all these universiies are somewhat biased and LUMS isn't even completely holistic as we have seen many times.

I want to pick up a proper skill during this break, like coding, data analysis, design, cloud stuff, or honestly anything useful and future-oriented.\n\nThe thing is, it is way easier to stay consistent when you have like-minded people around. So I was thinking, why not form a small group of motivated people who also want to learn a skill during this vacation? We can:\n\n* Decide on a skill (or multiple skills)\n* Set small weekly goals\n* Keep track of progress\n* Share resources and struggles\n* Hold each other accountable\n\nNo pressure, no competition. Just people trying to grow together.\n\nIf you are also free this vacation and want to actually learn something instead of letting the break disappear, drop a comment or DM. Even if you already have a skill in mind, that works.\n\nLet’s make this vacation count.",

        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a current LUMS student at SAHSOL, and I got in on the basis of LCAT with an FSC background. Over the past few weeks, I’ve seen many posts from applicants asking for guidance, especially those who feel unsure because of their grades, background, or overall profile.\n\nI just want to say this upfront: I was in the exact same boat last year.\nMy grades were not outstanding, and I genuinely thought my chances were slim. What made the biggest difference for me was a well-crafted, highly personalized personal statement that reflected my journey, motivation, and fit for SAHSOL.\n\nBecause of that experience, I want to help fellow applicants who are going through the same stress and confusion.\n\nHow I can help:\n\nPersonal Statement\n\nStructuring and refining your statement\n\nIdentifying strengths beyond grades\n\nDetailed review and personalized edits\n\n\nLCAT & SAT Preparation\n\nStudy strategies and resources that actually work\n\nPractice guidance based on LUMS’ testing style\n\nTime management and test-day tips\n\n\nExtracurriculars (ECs)\n\nHow to present your ECs effectively\n\nTurning ordinary activities into meaningful narratives\n\n\nTeacher Evaluations\n\nHow to approach teachers professionally\n\nWhat LUMS looks for in evaluations\n\nHelping you guide your teachers so they can write strong, specific recommendations\n\n\n\nI’m charging a minimal amount (PKR 2,000) for this.\nHonestly, I don’t want to take the money, but I feel this small amount keeps things serious and is still reasonable for a LUMS applicant. This is not a business—just peer-to-peer guidance from someone who recently went through the same process.\n\nIf you’re interested or have questions, feel free to comment or DM me.\nLooking forward to helping many of you—and hopefully meeting you on campus at LUMS.\n\nP.S. I didn’t join any academy or coaching center. I prepared independently and got into LUMS through self-study and a focused application—so everything I’m sharing comes from real, first-hand experience.\n\nBest of luck to everyone applying 🤍",

            "the main perks for acf at lums is, there are only 2 unis in pakistan that have association with ACCA,\n\nIBA and LUMS , you will get exemptions from a lot of initial acca exams , i think only 5 from final stage are left. (u can read more on their site), also from what i found the hands on experience, the opportunity to combine courses from other schools gives a holistic approach to learning, internship opportunities during the degree are great, and job opportunities seem much much better, exchange program opportunities.\n\nthere r 2 top bussiness schools in pakistan, lums and iba (that shld be your 2nd option)\n\ni myself am going to apply for lums' and when im free from lcat and march sat. gonna apply for iba second round of admission in same degree.\n\nalso, i learned for bussiness degrees in pakistan, the logo or tag matters a lot. (ii wld take nust as 3rd option but it states math as essential for acf - after it are 3rd tier unis UOL, UCP etc , i wont suggest further down into govt. unis like gcu, but depends completely on ones on pov )\n\nALSO, KEEP IN MIND, At lums you apply to school for the first year, in our case sdsb, you will have to declare major (acf or bba) at the end of the year, so for me i liked the fact ill be given time to explore my preference.",

The semesters ending now and ive had a hard time adjusting myself and i couldnt perform well at the start of the semester and now its too late i tried my best in finals but i still think i messed up and my gpas going to be messed up as well. However ill go over the course material for my spring semester in the upcoming semester break and hopefully aim for a 4.0. But even then if i dont meet the requirements and i dont get my desired major what am i supposed to do then???? Ive studied sciences all my life i failed econ in a levels and i dont see myself having a career in econ whatsoever, for econ cs at least i knew that i could take all cs courses without any issues.

I went through some personal problems back in o levels which affected my performance and I did explain what happened in my ps. Both of my ps are well written. Now do you know anyone with similar grades to mine in sse? Do you think if there's a possibility for me, or is it just like fully impossible with the Bs?",

For food, it depends on your eating habits. If you only get sabzi roti from pdc and 1-2 cups of tea per day around 800-1000 per day is like sufficient but if you want a bit mkore then its like 1100-1400 per day will most likely be enough. Also consider you will most likely be skipping breakfast most days unless you are a habitual early riser around 8/9am. So only major costs would be lunch and dinner so 1100-1400 is certainly doable for 2 good meals.",

            "2 B's isn't something thats very very major, yes it does seem major when at 17/18 years old but yes your SAT is good. I myself got into LUMS with 1B in O levels so having 1 or 2 B's is not that big of a deal if you have a good sat score and a level grades. If the reason you're writing about is very impactful and is part of who you are then sure include it in your PS otherwise make a new PS",
            "Im a junior and I don't have any internship as well because simply freshies and sophs are still considered relatively young and inexperienced compared to juniors and seniors. Do something which has an impact on your resume. Maybe try learning a bit of web development (html/css/js) or maybe self study a bit of CS200 itself since CS200 is a whole step-up from CS100.

Slow progress, but it’s something.\n\nScore breakdown:\n\n\t•\tMath: 520 (Algebra/Adv Math/Geometry & Trig: 470–540, Problem Solving & Data Analysis: 420–460)\n\n\t•\tReading & Writing: 450 (Information & Ideas: 370–410, Craft & Structure: 420–480, Expression of Ideas: 420–480, Standard English: 420–480)\n\nMy struggles:\n\n\t•\tWeak basics, especially math word problems & data analysis.\n\n\t•\tSlow passage comprehension in English.\n\n\t•\tOverthinking questions, especially when tired.\n\n\t•\tMental exhaustion; progress feels tiny.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\t•\tCan I realistically improve significantly in 2 months?\n\n\t•\tShould I retake SAT or focus on LUMS’ LCAT?\n\n\t•\tWhat should I prioritize instead of trying to do everything?\n\nI want practical strategies, not motivation. If you were me, what would you drop and double down on? Any success stories from similar starting points?\n\nI’m behind, but I don’t want to quit.",

Among the various other reasons that i dont necessarily wanna mention, after spending nearly 7 horrible months and concluding i hate this place, i see no future in a 3rd grade medschool just bcz of social pressure, decided on changing majors. one thing is for sure i dont wanna pursue medicine at a 3rd grade college, it suffocates me. the other options were law (my family isnt allowing as a female child) so im left with a bussiness degree. i actually digged deep into what ill be studying, it actually intriguies me, i wanna know more about the bussiness world and be able to fill the void of financial illiteracy in my soul. it not only secures me financially, also opens a solid path for my ambitions towards civil services (Foreign Ministry, ILR: In land revenue, PAAS, C&T, PAS etc) as I'm an extracurricular person, and the idea of  combining courses from law and humanities school excites me.\n\n\\[ 5 out of 14 lums alumini that qualified for css had bachelors from bussiness school, circa 2023.

Acf degree will be quite hard especially cause business courses are way different then sciences. Also, there are millions of acf majors graduating everywhere so you need to put the effort to make yourself unique. \nOn a side note, you are the first person I ever saw who likes hina rabbani 😭😭 (I only ever saw memes about her, even in lums groups (no offense)).",

            "and about acf majors graduating everywhere, from what i found, there is an increasin need of acf majors, in the big 4, in the past decade there was a void in these jobs, that affected, delayed and errored submissions of major bussiness group's financial statements, and then some nasty scandals took place in the following decade, now they are regulating, standardizing and also recruiting more highly qualified high gpa ppl from bussiness schools across the world,\n\nalso i used to hear this a lot back in medschool. according to the stuff i have been digging into and comparing, prospects for this major seems better than mbbs degree in pakistan, yes medicine in long run after 12-15 years is high yeilding thing, if u are lucky , and as u said hv to make ur self unique...\n\nalso i want this as a backup plan actually, for a basic paycheck, the fact that it comes with really good growing opportunity gives a heads on ig, managorial positions like hedge fund manager or becoming part of banking sector are solid options (i mean as someone young and filled with ambition, i wld rather look forward to the future with optimism, bcz atleast for now, i can, although i think ill have a hard time switching to something i dont have a base in...,,maths too... but i can always learn? i talked to ppl who know me they say it will not be that difficult for me, i can give my full to it? i can give bussiness school a try... medicine is one of the most difficult degrees to persue....how difficult can bussiness be....im quite used to working like zombies on caffeine in medschool, literally starving on horrible mess food, insomnia, 6hours per day, 6 days a week, one week summer break, no winter break. sigh\\* after the horrors of this year, that permanently altered my brain chemistry, anything less horrible than this, will suffice actually. i do love competitive environments, gives me good adrenaline rush actually. i dont mind the study grind actually, i just want a calmer environment  where i can see a future for myself.\n\nand degree from lums's bussiness school will catalyze the career growth a lot... especially expemtions from international certification exams, great internship opportunities as i have heard. also if i make it to the civil services, i will not be worried abt cooperate culture hassles. a bussiness degree combined with courses from law and humanities school is a solid base in my opinion, for css.\n\nthe great gamble of life it is.\n\nthanks for reading my reddit writeup, purely sponsored by overthinking. :P\n\nstranger on the other side of internet's void. hope uni doesnt break me fr. all bussiness majors ik are pretty chill tho 😭.",
            "😭😭its more abt the place she comes from. lol. now that i think of it, i have noticed this before, that lums' ppl's reaction too her mention in podcasts. but if you look at it from a different perspective, there are not many, (nearly non exsistent,) women from such a backward region in southern punjab, who made it that far in a career like hers,  mmmmm (lemme say it) baddies in state's political apparatus or foreign ministry of our country.\n\nbut thanks for pointing that out, i wont mention it further, cant explain my outlook to everyone.\n\nits just i do have better female ideals, like margret thatcher, BB, angela merkel, ang sun su chi etc but cant relate them to lums, to be put into my personal statement you see😭😭😭which is on my mind bohot ziada ajkl. been reading abt great women in history for like 2 years as a hobby, cant explain but it has truely influenced my thought process. 😭😭dk if that makes sense to you",

Not legendary. They weren’t necessarily head boys, national competition participants, or MUN maestros (even though top applicants often are). From what I’ve learned (as someone aspiring to apply in the next intake), you need to be able to prove that you understand the field you’re applying to and that you’ve demonstrated your knowledge and skills outside the classroom as well. You don’t have to be a jack of all trades, but you should at least show depth and competence in the area you’re applying for.",

Didn’t work. \nI took a gap year before I applied abroad and considering I apply next January, will it be considered 1 gap year or two? Also should I mention me studying abroad to them, I wish to come back as soon as I get the admission. Will it add extra points considering I’m studying at a good public university? \nMy A level grades are -(A- CS, B- physics, C- maths)\nO level- 2A* 5-6 As\nSAT- I had 1270 with a weeks prep, I’m preparing em and hoping to get 1500 for my March SATs. \nI will shoot my shot even if it’s considered hard but I need to know if my study abroad will count as a good thing or a bad. I can use it nicely in my personal statement because it is considered as using my gap year in a really productive way. ",

            "if u dont got one, u can look for a turnitin service here on reddit,.. just be careful on some scams. But if u need to run it through some free ones first that is accesible to know the flagged parts. This [breakdown review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataRecoveryHelp/comments/1ldlwos/ai_detector/) of ai checkers can help u with that. Best quick move thoo is to reread your work, make sure it sounds like you, fix any awkward or overly generic lines, and double check citations. If you’re really anxious, you can use tools like just to polish wording.. not to rewrite everything. And keep your drafts as proof. That matters way more than a lastminute % score",
            "When I'm in panic mode and need a quick AI and plagiarism check, the worst thing is waiting for some site to load or for limits to reset. If you want results fast, I'd try a few tools back-to-back just to be safe. I usually run checks with Turnitin first since that's what most schools use, and sometimes Copyleaks or AIDetectPlus (that one can do both AI and plagiarism at once if you need a double-check). \n\nHonestly, just having your bases covered across a couple of detectors is way better than getting blindsided by a single false positive. If you get wildly different results, screenshot everything for your records before you submit. Curious, is this for an assignment due tonight or something even crazier?",
            "Proofademic ai detector is a practical option if you need fast insight into ai and plagiarism risk, using an independent tool first can help. Proofademic ai gives a clearer, more balanced ai detection analysis without uploading your work to institutional systems. It’s useful for quick checks before submission, especially when Turnitin access is limited or risky.",

I'm currently studying C's but I'm uncertain if I'd want to select it as my major ahead in university. Look here are my concerns. In ssc I chose biology but later converted into Cs as it's quite evolving in the future ahead. But now that I look around me, almost everyone is choosing C's to pursue just because they think ke iska scope he. To escape the rat race, I chose Cs but to consider that I'll graduate in 2030, I think the market would get too saturated.\n\n\n\nNow as for me I've always wanted to do something that earns me respect and fame make my media presence. A career that opens global opportunities for me. I considered law initially but as I dig deep into it, I realized by law I don't necessarily look forward to defending client within the premises of courtroom but rather emerge as a representative in Un councils as diplomat it or stuff since I love doing muns and more specifically public speaking.I don't really wanna get stuck behind a desk but rather pursue a career that provides me the flexibility to travel globally. Media communication is a major that I'm kinda passionate about but I'm concerned about its stability in the future. I do really have quite a strong business mindset and so I'm thinking to major in business administration (bba) in my university. IVE also heard bba is useless in this era?? i mean im stuck bba vs cs.

            "In Pakistan yeah bba is useless, any generic business degree is kinda yk not that great so opt for more technical degrees like data analytics blend with business. Many bba offer major in business analytics and all. Its kinda a blend of cs and business. After this you can give CFA papers and be a financial analyst too. They are paid well. Just doing a 4 yr generic bba degree won’t get you anywhere. Delve deeply into it and get the most out of any field you have interest in. Actuarial sciences are also one of the underrated studies",

            "i totally fathom your view and where you're coming from but id like to ask since im the kind of a person whose multi passionate and who loves muns and public speaking, if i pair my bba degree with IR or media communication do u think these combinations are strong? furthermore, id appreciate if you can give me more insight about what business analytics really is like as a major. i mean im only familiar with acf and bba.   \nid really appreciate your response.",
            "Ook since i don’t know about that media blend with bba so can’t say anything concrete on that. Looks promising tho… and about business analytics, this proper degree isn’t offered by Lums at the moment. But there are programs like econ+cs+data science which is really good option. Proper degrees which are named business analytics/data analytics are offered at Fast and comsats at the moment. Obviously Lums is better than them at business so never choose these over lums as at lums even if you don’t get the degree but you can choose electives and all that extra sh!t to compensate for it. Business analytics teaches you how to use data to make better business decisions. It has business foundations like Accounting, finance, economics, HR, supply chain and management along with data analytics skills like programming languages, statistics and probability, excel, Sql and data visualisation. Its a generalised program, it leaves quite a room for masters in various types of programs."

So I wanted to address the number of such people in total are very very low. Most of them are the kids from the big schools and are aiming for US universities so they apply to Lums for safety and okay yes some extremely locked in people also apply to lums \n\nBut lums has a lot of people that are average a lot of people who did not change the world or spent 4 years working on their profile but it is competitive you need to understand that most of the people that get in did something with their life, like they did not achieve something mind blowing but they did something in their free time like ngo work or followed a passion or something and that’s it. \n\nBecause you need to understand that every year the competition is getting harder, due to which not a lot of people who did not do anything in their free time won’t get into lums. \n\nLong story short: NOT EVERYONE HAS MIND-BLOWING ECAS AND SAT SCORE, \n\nLUMS HAS A LOT OF AVERAGE STUDENTS LIKE I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE THAT GOT INTO LUMS WITH AVG GRADES AND SAT SCORES , BUT THEY DID SOMETHING WITH THEIR FREE TIME. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR FREE TIME. So stop making this a super big deal and chill out guys.",

            "It depends. If you're talking about senior positions in local corporations (C-suite, senior management), IBA leads by a big margin. From my discussions with faculty/admin at LUMS, there's two reasons for this:\n\n* IBA is in Karachi where most large corporates are based, so you'll be better off networking/university connections-wise (CEOs of HBL, Unilever, Reckitt come to mind).\n* The most exceptional LUMS graduates almost always go for further education and settle abroad. From my personal experience, people at LUMS who can move do move.\n\nOn average however, the LUMS grad will still earn more and have better career progression followed by IBA. FAST, NUST, etc. are not in the same category as people being successful there is anomalous.",

        "body": "So when applying I wanted to apply in MGHSS politcs and economics as my first preferred major and political science as my second preferred major. I very much prefer poli econ over poli sci tho. However I found out that if I apply for any economics majors I cannot be considered for the rest of the social sciences. The issue is that I don't think I'll get into poli econ/economics series because I've heard it is really difficult to get an admission in econ. I have 3A*s 2As and 2 Bs in o levels. A and B in AS (awaiting the result of the third subject). My ec's aren't very out there either. I'll be giving the SAT in march.  Should I apply for poli econ regardless and just give the SAT + what SAT score would be required for me to get in? Or should I just apply to Political science and other social science majors. ",

            "AI detectors are super unreliable and Grammarly can trigger false positives even though it's just grammar help. If you wrote it yourself you should be fine, LUMS doesn't auto-reject based on detector scores. If you're really stressed about it though, you could run your essay through humanizing ai tools like clever ai humanizer before submitting to avoid the false flag. It'll smooth out whatever patterns the detectors are picking up without changing your actual content.",

            "Bro it's so damn frustrating when all you've done is check a few synonyms and clean up with Grammarly, then every AI detector acts like you're some criminal mastermind. It's like they just see anything clear and structured as \"must be AI.\" Man, I've even tried running my stuff through detectors like GPTZero, Copyleaks, and AIDetectPlus and sometimes the scores literally make no sense. \n\nOne minute it's 0%, next it's 98% - kisi cheez ka koi logic nahi. Even the LUMS ones can sometimes overflag just for basic phrasing, I've seen it happen. When you know it's your original work, there's honestly nothing else to fix except maybe randomly throwing in a weirdly worded sentence. It's honestly just luck sometimes.\n\nIf you're really stuck, check with different tools just to see if there's a pattern - but honestly, half the people at uni are fighting this same drama. If your essay is personal and not generic, and you've got your draft history to prove it, that's your best backup in case they question you. \n\nWhat detector did the best for your text though? I'm proper curious if it's just us Pakistanis getting rinsed or it's global. Hope your LUMS guy doesn't overreact, bhai!",

It shouldn't be the case that upon first glance the reader can guage the essay(s) sounds unnatural.",

And these guys took me from zero to “finally understanding wtf I’m doing” with a level of patience I don’t even get from my own cousins 😭💀. They fixed my personal statement line-by-line, reshaped my ECs, taught SAT in a way that actually made sense, and literally followed up on my questions DAYS later like they remembered everything I said. That’s not consultancy energy — that’s “we actually give a damn” energy.\n\nAnd let’s be real for a second: SAT-Shark is new, small, and actually helping students at a price normal humans can afford… so obviously the big consultancy dudes (you know the ones who charge kidneys + lungs for ‘guidance’) are gonna feel threatened. Suddenly all the troll posts appear, all the “he said she said,” all the dramatic warnings 🙄. It’s just sad watching genuinely hardworking people get dragged because someone else wants to protect their overpriced empire. I’m not here to advertise anyone — I’m literally just a student who’s tired of watching honesty lose to noise. If Pakistan actually wants better student support, maybe stop attacking the only people who aren’t trying to squeeze our pockets dry. Anyway, that’s all.

I picked CS only because my friends did, not because I actually liked it. And now I’m paying the price for that stupid decision.\n\nI have zero interest in this field. I feel suffocated in every class. I’m constantly stressed, anxious, and mentally drained. There’s this actual physical pain in my chest now because of how overwhelmed I feel. I don’t even recognise myself anymore. My confidence is gone. Completely gone.\n\nThe worst part? I don’t dare to talk to my family about it. They ask me how university is going, and I just lie because I can’t bring myself to disappoint them again. I already took a gap year, and the thought of telling them I want to switch universities feels like I’m about to break their trust. It eats me alive every day.\n\nI’m seriously thinking about applying to LUMS because deep down, I know I don’t belong where I am right now. My academic background has always been strong, but this degree is destroying me mentally. Even talking to my own brother, who studies at LUM,S feels impossible. I can’t even ask him for advice because my confidence is at zero. I feel ashamed, stuck, and completely drained.\n\nI just want to reset everything. I just want to be in a place where I actually enjoy what I’m studying and don’t wake up every day with dread. I feel trapped, and I don’t know how to take the first step out of this mess.\n\nAnd honestly, if anyone reading this is about to choose a degree: **please go toward your passion, not the flow.** I’m saying this from experience. Don’t follow your friends, don’t follow trends, follow what *you* genuinely enjoy. Otherwise, you’ll end up exactly where I am: stuck, stressed, and mentally exhausted.\n\nI don’t know if anyone else has been in a similar situation, but I just needed to get this off my chest. I really hope I’m not too late to fix things.",

I feel like I may be good at accounting, even tho I don't know jackshit about the field. But I do have certain interest towards the business side, how banks work, how companies run etc. I feel like it'll also help in starting a family business aswell since my brother is in a similar field. The only fear I have is that I may not succeed in finding a good job afterwards and also, my parents want me to do BDS. I feel exhausted.

Specifically, can I mention my December SAT as well as my potential March SAT, so that the higher score can be considered?\n\nRegarding my academics, my O-Levels are strong (5 A\\*s and 3 As), and my A-Levels grades are 1 A in Maths and 2 Bs in Physics and Chemistry (C in Biology, but only the top 3 subjects are considered). I am considering SSE as my first preference and SDSB as my second. PLS CHANCE ME AS WELL\n\nI also have some extracurriculars, scholarships, and leadership experiences. During my gap year, I tutored A-Level students in Maths and Physics, took free online courses on Udemy for time management and communication, and prepared for the SAT. I had to take a break due to health reasons, but I have used this time productively.",

This is anecdotal, but bear with me. \n\nGrades > ECs > Personal statement\n\nThat is to say - if you have one or more amazing set of grades (between O/A Levels and SAT), then that can compensate deficiencies in other places very effectively. \n\n\nGood ECs are relevant and go a long way, but you'd be trying harder to compensate smaller deficiencies in grades. \n\nPersonal statements matter, but I haven't heard of an otherwise strong application being helped or hurt by them. \n\n\nBut also, unless its extremely obvious one way or another, LUMS is unpredictable. Have heard of people with 1200s get in. Have heard of people with 1400ish get rejected. Generally won't see anything at or above 1500 get rejected regardless. \n\n\nChill raho, unless you're in one extreme or another, your chances may as well be as good as everyone else in the median range for applicants. Do not let anyone else's scores get you down.",

Apply confidently.",

I noticed that i was the worst when i was hungry. So i talked to a physician. He recommended me to get different blood tests. For diabetes, cholesterol, lipid profile etc. turns out i was pre diabetic, had extremely high triglycerides and extremely low HDL. To the point that i was on the risk of getting heart attack. Im 32 btw. My physician  immediately told to change my life style and eating habits. And so i did. Along with that he prescribed some multi-vitamins, magnesium glycinate and omega 3 supplements. I was already taking magnesium glycinate. It did help me a lot. Its been 4 months and i havent shouted at anyone in my house. I do have some weak moments but i suddenly have this sabar that i would not even think of having 4 months ago. \n\nOf all them i guess magnesium glycinate helped me the most. I hope my story helps you as well. Talk to someone. Get your blood work done. And change your life style waghera waghera. \n\nBest of luck.",

            "For English, I’d suggest that you learn all the standard english convention rules by heart, and try not to get these questions wrong. For words in context question, I learned all the vocabulary words that I found difficult from the CB question bank as well as the 7 practice tests, and those were enough for me. If you’ve more time you can learn roots words, suffixes, prefixes etc. Then work on transitions. These questions imo are not that heard, but there are some odd transition words that you need to learn. These mostly show up on practice tests and CB Question Bank. You can make flashcards for the vocabulary words, as it’s easier to learn from them. \n\nFor Maths, I’d suggest that you watch the ottocento playlist by tutorllini test prep on yt. It’s a life saver. If you want, you can only go through the topics you’re weak at. You can also learn how to use desmos, but I only used it for the ‘number of solutions’ questions. And, for the CB question bank start with easy questions then gradually move toward medium, and hard questions.",

            "Reaching out to teachers regarding recommendation letters, especially when you're on a gap year, can be challenging. However, it's not impossible. We'd suggest reaching out to them formally and explain your situation a bit. Since it's a formal venture, we'd recommend reaching out via email, but any mode of contact will make do. Try using this template:\n\nSubject: Request for Recommendation Letter for LUMS Admission\n\nDear [Teacher’s Name],\n\nI hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to kindly request a recommendation letter from you for my application to LUMS. Your class had a significant impact on me, and I believe your perspective on my work and character would greatly strengthen my application.  \n[This is generic, talk about the specific impact their class had on you and your learning] \n\nDue to a severe case of typhoid making me unable to keep track of admissions deadlines over the past 5 months, I was forced to take a gap year. I’ve used this time to fully recover and refocus, and I’m now preparing to continue my academic journey with renewed clarity and motivation.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I’d be happy to hop on a quick Zoom call at your convenience to discuss any details, logistics, or specific points the recommendation might need to address.\n\nPlease let me know if you would be comfortable writing the letter, and if so, whether you need any documents or information from my side (CV, transcripts, personal statement, etc.).\n\nThank you very much for your time and support. I truly appreciate it.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Contact Information]",

Sir Talal’s teaching style is clear, paced properly, and focused on building actual understanding instead of shortcuts. What helped me the most were the resources and practice material available on the Tutoria portal — everything was organized, updated, and easy to follow during revision.\n\nI personally felt a noticeable improvement in my consistency and confidence with both Math and English sections after completing the course. While every student’s experience can be different, I do think Tutoria provides solid support and a good learning environment for SAT preparation.",

        "body": "*i wish i had performed better in matric...i wish i hadn't wasted my o level years. what will i do with a bunch of C's and a 70%?*  \n*i don't know if i can make it to LUMS. my SAT score...only one attempt remaining in March.*   \n*if only i had more extracurriculars...i'm worthless...*\n\n**Stop. That. Voice.**\n\nYou've heard this. You hear this in your head everyday. If not in your head, other people make sure to tell you how worthless and stupid you are. What you \"could\" have done, what you \"should\" have done in the past. You base your whole worth on whether you get into LUMS or not. \n\nNever-ending chance me posts, endless comparisons, reaffirmations, panic attacks and sporadic bursts of anxiety. It's common, but not normal. It comes from a thinking bias known as...\n\n**The Sunk Cost Fallacy.**\n\nIt means that what you have done in the past is gone. The cost of sleeping and lazing around was a bad grade. You paid for it. But ruminating over it, ruining your mental health because of it? That is irrational. No, really. You lazed around, you got C's and B's. Done. Over.\n\nYou didn't work hard in A Level? Okay. Fine. That's done.\n\n**Does it define your worth?**\n\nNo.\n\nIt doesn't...\n\n*but i wanted to get into LUMS...*\n\nWhy are you letting your entry into an institute define your whole self-worth and confidence? It's over. Not your life. I mean your past. Your past is over. For everyone. For the one who got 13 A\\*s, for the one who got 5 C's. It's over. You can't change that. And I'm not here to give you fake hope or a golden glimmer of false sunshine, but I do want to tell you some solutions to this, focused on the PRESENT and planned for the FUTURE.\n\nHere's what you can do now.\n\nFirst of all, just forget you ever had an academic or social life before today. Like literally. It's gone. Blank slate time. Erase it. Write it down if you have to, burn the piece of paper and step on the ashes. Sunk costs should remain sunk. No need for them to resurface.\n\nThen, look at it logically. Use AI if you have to rationalise your thoughts. You still have an asset. \n\n*what asset...? i'm worthless...*\n\n**Time.**\n\nYes. Time. Calculate the hours you have left. Let me break it down for you. The LUMS application deadline is on January 26, 2026. 5:00 p.m. As of December 1, 2025, you have 56 days. 1364 hours. Those are what you can control now. Make the most of them. If you haven't given the SAT, or want to improve your score, you have till March 14, 2026. That's 102 days. 2450 hours. \n\nI'm going to be generous here and list down every single thing you can possibly do in 56 days for your application, but you have to be dedicated and strong enough to put in the effort, to overcome the sunk cost delusion.\n\n* Do a course on Coursera related to your major. It will just take maximum 100 hours, which is 10% of your whole time left. Paid certificate? It's 35-40 dollars. That's 10k to 11k rupees. You spend that much on food delivery in a week. Save up\n* Write your personal statement like it's your final lifeline. Come up with a story, a narrative. Something about your journey. Personalised stuff. Do it well. Ask for advice, help, anything. It does matter. SHOW LUMS that you are more than your grades and exams. Please! Takes around 5-10 hours max, that's 1% of your time.\n* Study hard for your A2 exams or mid-terms. It doesn't matter what your O Level/Matric results are, or even your AS results. We discarded all that. Predicted grades go a long way, especially if you're sitting for composite.\n* Intern at a college counselling firm, any tuition firm or ANY online educational thing for free. Ask for a certificate.\n* Suck up to your teachers. Ask questions. Get those letters of recommendation. This is make or break. Trust me!!!\n* Prepare for the SAT. Download books. Find resources. Put your heart and soul into it. It's your last chance, but it IS a chance.\n* LUMUN is coming. SIGMA X (LUMS Math Olympiad) is coming. Many events will come, do the winter school if you have money, go to events. Get certificates. \n\nDon't look back on what you can't control. Turn your back on the past.\n\nIt's over.\n\nBut, your future isn't over. Your life isn't over. Good luck.",

(or you may switch that up as you like), tell them how you'll use lums as a platform to reach your relative goals, what resources of theirs you could use to gain success, what sparks your interest in the chosen subject. you can write about how, once you get the degree, you'll contribute to real-life applications, and write about previous similar experiences, and what soft/hard skills you developed during. remember, the first draft WILL be extremely messy and unstructured, and that all the refinement and beautification will be done later. it's the only section of your application where you aren't asked about your grades, so be smart with it. \n\nafter writing down a considerable draft, revise, revise, revise. check for any grammatical/spelling errors (u may use chat gpt for this but you can dm me as well). let your writing marinate, and keep coming back every other day to update any facts or phrasings which may seem off to you.\n\ngood luck with writing your ps, man. if anyone needs help regarding this, feel free to dm!!",

What should they give 1st preference to ? the cs + econ + math joint major or pure cs major ? \nI did a lot of digging and im still a little skeptical because of each major’s drawbacks. For instance, the joint major sounds too diluted and the possibility of employers preferring pure majors instead of the combined ones (though i get that its on the person on how to shape the degree and by working to gain the extra skillset that cs majors would have, idk if its worth it?). Then as a slightly above average student it sounds too competitive. dont get me wrong, i am all in for working hard, but its just my low self esteem sabotaging me. \nPersonally, at the moment, from what i already have experience in I would love to study business/economic s aspects along with programming skills.

I have witnessed students on 100% FA one year being rejected the next year and then having to go through multiple appeals without guarantees. I don’t know the process for NOP but if there is a possibility for you to apply through that I would suggest that. \nFinancial Aid at LUMS is also structured in loan forms so even if you get 100% you might be required to pay back a certain amount. If that’s the case then it depends on your major and whether that’s worth it.",

        "body": "Hello guys. I have a very specific question regarding the LUMS admission process. \n\nSo basically, I graduated from the International Baccalaureate (IB) in Pakistan in may 2025 and I've decided to take a gap year to take some exams before I (intend to) enter LUMS in fall 2026. I'm applying currently but I know that foreign qualifications like the IB require an equivalence certificate if they've been done in Pakistan. Before IB I was in an American school system in a foreign country and didn't do O-level subjects like Islamiyat, Pakistan Studies, and Urdu. To get an equivalence certificate I need to pass these exams at this level and cannot be admitted to university in Pakistan until I have that certificate. Now my question is that if I give these exams next year in may and pass then is there a chance I'll still be admitted to lums if I meet their basic requirements and submit my application in time but there's just a delay in the process of obtaining the equivalence certificate? Like how strict are they with the deadlines and how quickly you can submit all required documents. Will they be lenient and still accept me or will I miss the window? I intend to submit my online application in like this week or next week, take the exams next year in the next session and get the equivalence certificate asap.\n\n  \nI hope this made sense. I would greatly appreciate your help :)",

I'm targeting roles in the UK in investment banking; as a backup I'm actively interviewing in Dubai too since my visa expires soon.\n\nMeanwhile I have an offer from a boutique M&A shop in Karachi for PKR 150,000/month\nI'd appreciate candid input on the following from those working in finance in Pakistan (ideally IB / banks like Citi, Standard Chartered Bank, big local banks, or boutique advisory firms):\n\n1. Salary benchmarks: • Is 150 k/month a typical junior analyst salary in Pak in M&A / corporate finance? • What are the salary ranges at Citi or SCB in Pak for graduate/entry level (with a strong UK-based degree background)? • How do bonuses, carry, or variable compensation typically work in IB / advisory space in Pak?\n2. Market experience & scope: • Is the deal flow meaningful (cross-border, large corporates, private equity) or mostly domestic, smaller transactions?\n3. Boutique advisory / M&A firms: • What are some of the other well-regarded boutique M&A/ advisory houses in Pakistan that people respect (for deal work, training, reputation)?\nThanks in advance to everyone who shares their insight.). I am ideally hoping to get anything relevant in Uk/Dubai but gotta keep the options open.\n\nCheers.",

However, during these days, I got to know that I should also apply for lums bsaf degree due to it’s worth so am preparing for sat at the moment for Dec attempt. Would highly appreciate if you guys tell me that with 98per in matric and 84 per in fsc what should I score in SAT and for eca’s(having few certifications from school and some others not very diverse and significant) would help me in securing admission thks!",

Its got pretty handy grammar tips and all that stuff but for the reading portion you’ve gotta just read articles and novels etc to improve your reading skills overall and also always try to understand what is being said in the passage you’re reading rather than reading it for the sake of it.",

I will also be appearing in the LCAT this year along with the SAT.\n\nI feel like I can improve my Math score very easily in a few days since I’ve already studied everything from College Panda and Barron’s Math — I just need to review and repeat to be confident. English will take more time, but I think taking the December SAT could still be very useful for exposure and to identify my weak areas.\n\nThe 36–37k PKR fee is a bit of a burden, but if the December test will really help me improve and prepare for March, I feel it’s worth it."

This justification could involve learning a new skill, doing productive things (such as reading books or taking part in volunteer work), or simply needing time to explore new things or take a break before starting university. Ensure activities are tied to the skills needed for your chosen major. For instance, if applying to SDSB, focus on internships, entrepreneurial projects, or finance courses.

He said that LUMS is highly competitive and that Edmaxex has helped him get admission in lums by working on his profile and making his profile unique. Then I met the team after that, honestly I was convinced enough that they know what they are doing. I am a cynic person and I accidently asked if they could show me Lums SMART card and tbh two counsellors and a writer were there , three of them had a Lums Alumni cards and i felt bad for doubting their credibility. Anyways , I availed their services and tbh they are putting much efforts and are caring about my application more than I do (Literally). So imo taking consulting services is a subjective choice, but to those who have strong academics and can afford their services should definitly do.\nSo to answer your question! for me their help and counsellors have been worth it so far.",

SDSB is definitely in reach with that 1410 SAT because it's above average, as LUMS mentions on its website. The decision will come down entirely to those 'Pretty Strong' ECs. SDSB appreciates seeing genuine business/leadership experience, as well as quantitative rigor (which your Math/Physics/Business A2 combination effectively supports). Ensure good grades in A-level and focus on making your essay connect those impressive ECs to your program choice. Having said that, there's always uncertainty, which comes to the level of competition, the number of seats available, etc. The decision committee evaluates your grades in O/A-levels, ECAS, personal statement essays, awards & honors, and their relevance to the chosen academic programme; everything is taken into account.",

If you don’t know how to write personal statements, structure ECAs, or secure strong recommendation letters, consulting makes sense. Lack of proper guidance can actually decrease your chances, so getting help from someone experienced is wise.

But my friend who was also applying got accepted with almost similar academic profile, she then recommended Edmaxex to me, and tbh I had a great experience with them. I got accepted with the same credentials except for my SAT which improved thora sa. So I would say Edmaxex definitely helped me get in.

You get accepted to school, and after completion of the first year, you apply for major declaration in that school, or if you plan to transfer to another school, that also works if you meet the set requirements of the programme like CGPA, required courses, etc.",
            "For hss you declare it after your sophomore year",
            "What about the Econ Math and econ compa sci majors at hss? Do you declare them after your sophomore year, too? Are they more competitive than other majors. what’s the minimum GPA or requirement you need to meet to get em?",
            "It's after first year now for hss too",
            "Yes, they are more competitive. Here you go with all the details and requirements.\n\n**Entry Requirement for the Economics and Mathematics Joint Major:** A student wishing to major in Economics and Mathematics must have the following, at the time of applying for this major: 1) A CGPA of 3.3 or above. 2) A minimum ‘B’ grade, both in Calculus-I/Calculus-I (Honours) and Linear Algebra with Differential Equations/ Linear Algebra I (Honours). The maximum number of students accepted into this major each year is 30.\n\n**Entry Requirement for the Economics, Data and Computer Science Major:** A student wishing to major in Economics, Data and Computer Science must have the following, at the time of applying for this major: 158 159 1) A minimum CGPA of 3.3 at the end of the first year. 2) Successful completion of CS 100 \\\\ CS 1001 Computational Problem Solving \\\\ Computational Problem Solving with Python, ECON 111 Principles of Microeconomics, and ECON 121 Principles of Macroeconomics with a CGPA of 3.3 across the three courses The maximum number of students accepted into this major each year is 30.",
            "You declare them at the end of your freshman year after completing the requirements. The cut off GPA is 3.3, but as these two majors are pretty competitive aiming for a 3.5-3.6+ can get you a seat. There are only 30 seats as of now. (hoping they increase them)",
            "Oh really? Like it will actually be declared after freshman year?",
            "What if student doesn't get a seat in Econ/Data science but he can still opt their courses right?   \nSuppose he has to join BS Economics stream, how many additional courses he has to pick from CS and Data science to do the minor in it?  \nWont it be ALOT of courses for him? First all courses of Economics stream and then additional courses of CS and DS ?",
            "Aight So, a 3.5-6 GPA will lowk guarantee me a seat?",
            "Yes. They changes it",
            "lowkey yes, but not sure yet because the number of students are wayyyy too much the more im noticing (pray i get the seat dawg)"

Usually, in CS and Econ &Maths, and from last year, they have started a new major econ & Data Sci & CS, most of the students usually take those majors and competition gets tough and only toppers get those majors.

If yes how much to score in sat or lcat to be on a safe side,one of my siblings already studies at top engineering uni and it's quite expensive but he's on fa there too.So I'm quite confused if any of you can help I'll be grateful 🥲 father's salary is around 1.5 lakh don't have our own house and a car worth 40 lakh he's a property dealer part timedon't know if I should mention it or not cuz it's not a permanent source can't count this too",

            "You have genuine reasons that you can't afford the fees. Moreover, you have proof that you got a 100% scholarship in your school, which strengthens your case. You have other valid reasons to prove that you can't afford education.  Try to get admission first, you will get FA inshallah.",
            "So you are saying OP won't get the scholarship because of 1 house and a 40 lakh plot. That is the saving of his father's whole life. Lums fee for 4 years is double the price of the plot mentioned. Is lums that cruel? And another thing that bothers me is that, someone a little less privileged will get the scholarship and his just because he is poor. While another person who is doing good but cannot afford lums will be rejected. Universities do have an impact on your whole life.",
            "So how much is LUMS’s total yearly fee, including admission and hostel charges? I’ve searched a lot, but some places say it’s 17–18 lakhs, some say 21–22 lakhs, and others say 24 lakhs. I could never afford that much. My grades are really good, and I have a lot of extracurricular activities too, so all my teachers told me that I should go to LUMS.\nMy father and mother both are ill and don’t want to put that much pressure on my father.\nAnd I know he would never be able to pay that much fees",

But then I asked one of my friends, and he told me that LUMS’ fee is around 14–15 lakh. So I thought there isn’t much difference in the fee, and I might as well go to LUMS. However, my SAT score is low ,1250 ,so I planned to retake it in December. But because of the situation at home, I haven’t been able to study. So if I could get some financial aid, I would be able to go; but I want to be sure that I’ll get it  otherwise, all my effort will go to waste, and I’ll end up wasting a whole year.",

There are students who don't even have a quarter of what op does and it's obvs they would be considered more for fa, it's a known fact that unis will look for several reasons not to give fa. My fam only has one property and no car listed under our name and mine got rejected twice. It happens to several students worldwide.",
            "How do u know the guy who is poorer isnt also doing good and doesnt have better grades than op.whats so unfair about this? Obbiously fa will go to guy who doesmt even have land or any assets to pay for lums compared to the guy who has land",

        "body": " Hey everyone!\nI’m planning to apply to LUMS for Business School (Fall 2026). Last year, my personal statement was quite strong, but unfortunately, I didn’t perform as well on the test and didn’t have any extra certificates or extracurricular achievements like volunteering, leadership, or economic activities.\n\nThis year, I really want to improve my profile and build a stronger application beyond academics.\n\nI’m currently living in Islamabad/Rawalpindi, so I wanted to ask:\nAre there any places or organizations here where I can do volunteer work or leadership programs?\nWhere can I get certificates or experience related to business, entrepreneurship, or community service that can strengthen my LUMS application?\nAlso, are such activities actually helpful or recognized by LUMS admissions?\nWould really appreciate any guidance or suggestions from seniors or anyone who has gone through this process. \nThanks in advance!

They just require you to list your awards and extracurrilculars. \n\nI have done a few things like cricket in school (I do have a medal but not a certificate for that) a youtube course (which I don't have certificate for).

And that list will contain each Extracurricular activity you mention in ECs portion and Awards as well. So you will have to upload certificate or any other proof (here, medal can work also). Moreover, after submitting the proofs like certificates they don't dig deeper to find authenticity. I uploaded result card of one of my scholarship which was showing that I have been selected for scholarship which I submitted in Awards waala section, so you can do that as well don't worryyy too much ECs, your first focus should be entry tests like SAT/LCAT as they play huge role in your admission.",

        "body": "I want to attend SDSB at LUMS, but I’m concerned about my academic record. I completed my FA in Arts with subjects like Civics, Education, and Psychology, scoring between 80–90%. However, my matric grades were 54% in science subjects, and I worry that this and the common perception of FA being less prestigious in Pakistan might affect my chances.\n\nDespite these concerns, I’m determined to join LUMS and eventually SDSB. I’m preparing for the SAT with a goal of scoring above 1400 to strengthen my application. I know LUMS admits FA students with over 70%, but the competition and stereotypes still make me uncertain. Any guidance or advice from those familiar with the process would be greatly appreciated.",

One is when you have to apply, the earlier you apply the better so if the LUMS application open after March then it’s best to do it. Another is the condition. If you gave the SAT in December you’d have less time to study and you would have to focus less on ur FSC/A levels. In March you can give it however it’ll be really close to the CAIE which you have to prepare for too so it depends on if you can handle studying for both SAT and A levels simultaneously or not",

I am studying the entire day, I dont have any societies, I dont go to events or concerts or even out with friends. I dont leave topics before going in for a quiz or an exam and yet I get this mental block during them.\n\nEven if I know something, it will not have the complete info for me to secure the full marks in that specific question.\n\nI am out of ideas as to what I can try, I found out that people actually have studying techniques. Mine is simply sitting down and studying everything, from lecture slides to practising questions but its evidently mot working.\n\nCan you guys help me find out where im lacking or some suggestions that can take me from avg to the best in class?",

It isn't particularly difficult at all, the way people say, just mind numbing and boring khwaari. Plus doctor ban'ne ki scope is tightening every day. Then again, it might be right for you. I was someone much more inclined towards philosophy and just half assed my way to where I am now. Just be clear on the realities of being an MBBS doctor aaj kay zamanay mein.

Didn't give mdcat as well. So yeah I'm just having the sweetest of my time.\n\nNow I just don't know what to do other than rotting at home.\n\nSo in a way when ppl like you who made it with medicine say it's not what they thought it was, kinda makes me relieved in a sense ?

            "To your first paragraph, you're right, but wo issue baad ka hai. The immediate problem is that the five years you spend getting your hands on the diploma are basically five years in a high stakes FsC based pressure cooker. The best you can hope for is a game of chicken, like I'm doing - don't even try to meet attendance requirements but do well enough on exams that they don't create an issue for you. It doesn't get any better than that. Which is grim. \n\n\nIf you like innovation and the human body, go into biotech and research man. That's where the critical thinking is happening and new ground is being broken. Or IDK, take this time to explore some things. What do you like doing for your hobbies? How would you like your life to look in ten years?\n\n\nI totally get what you mean with the relief thing. The best bit is that it's actually the truth and not cope. You are absolutely in a very good position right now to take stock and think about what you really want. To be clear, I never expected to like medicine. I just thought it would be more stimulating. It was the opposite. \n\n\nSorry about the paragraphs lol, don't like the idea of younger people being fed bullshit dreams about \"daaktari\".

But i've heard that LUMS favors applicants who have gotten above 85% avg in 9th and 10th but mine is around 84.4%. That is why im worried that i might not even get in the first shortlist for SCO (summer coaching session). Can someone tell me if i have a chance to get shortlisted for SCO?",

Just start looking into your mistakes and tell chatgpt what mistakes you are making and how can you improve it.\nAs someone who had a 1400+ score, i wouuld say, english takes a lot of to improve but maths can be improved faster. Try to reach your max in maths section(atleast 750+) and then even if you get a 650- 700 in english. You are sorted. I would say maths is where the score growth is faster and easier."
