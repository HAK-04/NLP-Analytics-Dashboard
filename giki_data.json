Matlab this just fucked up atp I can't believe I have to say this. And also if you think this doesn't affect you, this will in a few years, cuz the kid that saw his father die under rubble did pray that the same happens to everyone that made that happen, if there's no alternative for the thing you want, then tell the shopkeeper to get the Pakistani alternative for that thing, if 50 people say that he WILL get the alternative.",

Granted that usny seller level py boycott nhi kiya, but in the consumer economy, consumer ki responsibility comes first.",

            "Bhai people in Pakistan haven't stopped using Fiverr which is literally based in Israel so why would they boycott brands like KFC.",
            "I feel some of us (Pakistanis) have inferiority complex like I hear people say “but Pakistani products aren’t that good” like shut up I know many international brands/chains/products that don’t fund a goddam geno also you can always find Turkish, Korean , Middle Eastern stuff. I changed my whole makeup and skincare to Pakistani and other (less popular int brands) and my skin is just fine. Whilst travelling to isb/topi my family eats sufi or daily deli at Behra and they’re hundred times better , cheaper and actually savoury acc to the Pakistani taste buds but people are always freaking out at MC, kfc , Hardees, DD . There’s even CBTL and monal fusion now, like atp Pakistanis are just rage baiting that know we got money and we actually just eat/buy this",

            "Why do you think Israeli brands are all over the world ? is it because they are Israeli? No , they simply make 1st class products in any genre , while we barely make the cheapest quality product with the same price as them , so why would people buy a third rate product with the same price ? \n\npeople can only boycott for so long , the world does not revolve around us .\n\nbtw did you know fiver is also an Israeli company but no one is gonna boycott their lively hood for that , we boycott things which are easy to do while not facing the hard reality that we don't make anything good \n\ntldr : boycott is not a long term solution and we are shit are manufacturing",
            "It's easier said than done. Corporate big giants don't become big giants they manipulate they way to become big giants. You wanna boycot KFC. Oh no, they launched a deal reducing their prices to half they were yesterday and boom people go back to them. For Coke and Pep, they agreed to compete against each other, but when the third person kicks in, they ally with each other. These israeli products are a large part of a large-scale operation to dominate the world, and to challenge domination, one must have domination, and all the domination their is in the market are the israeli products. \n\nIt's so easier said but harder to do."

        "body": "If you’re thinking about coming to GIKI, don’t. Seriously, let me save your life.\n\n1. Academics & Future Prospects\nThe GPA situation is tragic. Around 65% of the batch graduates with a CGPA below 3.0. If you’re planning for foreign admissions—USA, Canada, Australia—good luck bro, because that low GPA will haunt you.\nEurope? Public universities basically won’t accept you, and private ones cost the same as Canada or Australia, so what’s even the point? If l have to push through all these things alone and work twice as hard just to get a GPA that students in average universities can get without killing themselves, then what's the point of studying at GIKI and paying such a high fee?\n\nMy point is that see the effort it takes to get a 3+ gpa here and at the end an average IQRA university student easily graduate is in more advantage than us, is that fair? And what's the point of \"GIKI makes you physically and mentally prepared for all the bad outside world\" what's the point of having hardship by your own will? Are you mad? Jab hardship aani hogi aajayegi, tab ka tab dekha jayega, is ka ye matlab thori hao k 4 saal jaan kr apne aap jo zaleel krwao k \" ma tou hardship le rha hu taake aage faida ho\"\n\n2. Location = Suffering\nGIKI is painfully isolated. After Thursday, there’s nothing to do unless you’re a chars addict—then maybe you’ll “enjoy life.”\nA normal human? Absolutely doomed.\nOur “premium” nearby restaurant is Sharjah Hotel, and to get there we ride in the legendary Sazgar rickshaw. After 10 minutes of shaking like a washing machine, we reach and eat food that tastes like a dare.\nCampus food? Worse than filler episodes.\n\n\n3. Laundry = Wardrobe Murder\nThe laundry guy will destroy your clothes like it’s his passion project.\nRed shirt? Comes back white.\nWhite shirt? Comes back yellow.\nIt’s like he washes everything in battery acid.\n\n4. Assignments & Quizzes\nAssignments and quizzes aren’t taken in class, and in the last two months after mids we’re “free” till 7–8 PM every day—free, but dead inside. No structure, no plan, just vibes and pain.Pakistan ki har university max 5 pm tk free kr deti yahan tou 8 baj jaate\n\n5. Girl-to-Boy Ratio\nThe ratio is so bad people don’t even bother dressing up. Kis k liye kapre pehnein?There are more wolves/pigs roaming around than actual girls.\n\nZero audience = zero effort.\nYahan kapre pehn lo tou 10 log poochne lag jaate “ kahan ja rha ha bhai”\n\nAur girl to boy ratio har sense ma affect krti, 1/10 apne aap ko 10/10 smjhti, balke kiun nai smjhegi jab 10/10 larke unn k peecha peecha bhagein ge kiun k unn k paas khud koi option nai, Main tou female interaction hi bhool gya hu, khak groom kiya ha iss uni ne, jitna confidence tha wo bhi gya.\n\n6. Society Culture = 3-Year Free Labor Internship\nSocieties here are insane. You lose your self-respect for 3 years doing unpaid labor for seniors—running around, doing errands, acting like their personal workforce—just so you can bully juniors in final year and feel “healed.”\nThey call this “leadership.” 💀\nMeanwhile at LUMS/IBA, societies look like actual student clubs.\nOurs? A pyramid scheme without payout.\n\n7. For students at GIKI, the whole ragging culture can feel straight-up nasty. It doesn’t feel like bonding.it feels like bullying wrapped up as tradition. Some juniors feel pressured into humiliating stuff just to get accepted into societies, and everyone acts like that’s just the way things are.\n\nIt messes with people. Confidence fades, you shut down inside, and some walk away carrying pain they never deserved. The shouting, the intimidation, the power trips it hits hard, especially for boys who often get the worst of it, from mockery to crossed boundaries.\nTo those going through it, it feels toxic and draining. And the worst part is the silence .the feeling that no one speaks up \n\n\n8.Internet, Environment, Campus Life\nInternet? Trash.Society? Conservative and close-minded.Transport? Forget “respectable,” we barely have functional. The LMS system is outdated, \n\nNo proper transport is available, Islamabad ya Peshawar jaane k liye ya tou 7000 ki taxi krwao ya 300 ki local bus mai jao. Main mazak nai kr rha ek baar ek bnda bakra apni lap ma le kr mere saath beth gya seat par, that was the first and last time mein uss van ma betha.Sath ek banda ne van k andar hi spitting shuru kr di.Banda kahan mare\n\nItna bara naam ha “GIKI” kuch tou arrangements  honi chaiye transport ki. In ki 2 buses chalti hain jis ki booking ek hafta pehle krwani parti uss time insan ko pta bhi nai hota k uss ka plan hai bhi k nai jaane ka next week , cuz it depends on the circumstances. Also agar qismat ho tou carpool mil jaati ya sharing pe gari, but rare hota k uss time aur uss din mil jaye jab aap ko jaana ho .\n\nHeaters don’t work. Half the hostels don’t have hot water, so people run between hostels like IDPs just to take a shower.Car? Pointless. Management will create problems just for sport.\n\n9 The medical facilities- here are honestly a mess—everything feels outdated, and the so-called doctors are basically nurses just sitting in doctor offices with no modern equipment in sight. Their answer to every problem is the same old “har cheez ka hal Panadol hai,” even if someone’s dealing with something as serious as a heart attack. The pharmacy shuts down by 4:30 pm sharp, and after that there’s nowhere to get medicine. If you need to go outside to buy anything, you have to go through a long permission process, and the nearest pharmacy is still a 10-minute walk away.\n\n10 Food: The campus has like 3–4 ‘restaurants’ and a central mess, but honestly the food tastes awful. Because options are so limited, you’re basically forced to eat there. The biggest place, ‘Raju Hotel,’ is even owned by someone in the university administration—so yeah, we’re pretty much doomed. It’s a pretty isolated place, Topi Sawabi naam ha jaga ka , kehte hue cringeout hota banda.The so-called restaurants aren’t really restaurants—they’re more like dhabas. Even the tuck shop area feels like a random quetta hotel you’d find in Sargodha. Waiters chow-mien ko jab “CHOOMIAN” bolein tou bande ka khane ka bhi dil nai krta😭.Kahin se bhi university wali vibe nai aati. I visited NUST recently pta lgta h atmosphere dekh kr k ek achi university ha, proper cafes hain etc 😭.Compare that to LUMS in main DHA Lahore, which has over 10 proper cafes and restaurants inside campus—it’s a whole different vibe, \n\nOh, and the water? FULLY CHLORINATED. My head is half bald now. Bro I came here to study engineering, not to speedrun male-pattern hair loss.\n\nlocation sucks, GIRLS becharin yahan rikhsaws ma zaleel horhi hotin baggy pants pehn kr, like wtf yar, tars aata unko dekh k,\n\nEvents? We get 5–6 random singers a year. Islamabad/Lahore get better artists in a single event than all ours combined. log kehte k giki ma events boht hote, singers boht aate, ma ke rha hu k agar apki uni city ma ho tou sirf ek \"taste fest\" wale festival ma hi itne singers aajate k aap ko apni uni k events pe rely nai krna parta.tou it doesn't matter k giki ma events hote ziada.\n\nAnd chars culture… bro… everyone’s puffing something. If you’re NOT a chars addict, you’re considered abnormal, mummy-daddy, or “odd one out.”\nBeing sober is the actual red flag here\n\nUniversity main raat 12 bjte hi har 1/3 room main se chars k clouds nikal rhe hote hain. Banda washroom jaye tou window se clouds aajaate, kahan marun mein. Students se ziada drug addicts hain idhar, wardens ko 200 rupee pakrao tou wo khud ap k saath peeta ha. Aur naswar tou Yahan bubble ki tarah khai jaati, like awain hi mazak mazak mei. Kahan se ye ek groom/educated logo ki university lagti ha, mujhe aaj smjh nai aayi k iski inti hype kiun hai\n\nEveryone says giki wale bahar jaate ya unhe jobs mil jaatin , well let me explain, bahar jaate hain tou apne paiso se jaate hain sab hi well off hote tou iss ma GIKI ka koi role nai + 10-15% of the batch wese hi overseas people hote jo graduate k baad direct apne countries jaate the moment they graduate + 15% of the batch financial aid par hota unhe koi bhi job miljaye wo khush rehte+ sab influential logon k bache hote , sab k koi na koi contacts hote tou un ki uss basis par means k sifarish par jobs lag jaatin. Jo reh jaate hain wo 3+ gpa wale hote unn ki jobs in Pakistan easily lag jaati since a GIKI graduate with 3+ gpa is preferred over any other graduate. Kuch apna business ma chale jaate kiu k well off hote already. Iss liye hamain aisa lagta ha k GiKi walo ki jobs lag jaatin, This is the breakdown. \n\nYe aisa hi ha jaisa Harvard has produced the most billionaires in the world kiun k Harvard main donation ki basis pe bhi admission mil jaata ha aur jo log heavy amounts of donations de skte wo already billionares k bache hote tou unho je tou billionare hi hona ha na in future. Same goes with oxford, zulfiqar ali bhutto, benazir bhutto, bilawal, nawaz sharif’s grandson, ye sab itne laik thori hein, ye log influential hain and the oxford’s admissions committee knows k inho ne hi aage ja kr influential banana hain since their families are influential and they know k kitna potential inka famous hone ka in future tou they give them admissions. \n\n\nRemember: “This university is for an extremely Introverted career oriented “engineer “, who has financial constraints.”Understanding what I said in the previous lines , sab k bas ki baat ha, so agr nai smjh aayi tou kia kr skte\n\nAnd yes after even after passing the test, 35 to 40% of the batch is put on probation or kicked out of the university.\n\nMaine tou guzar lia ha apna time almost aur koshish ki hai k log avoid krein yahan aana but still agar shouq poora krna ha aur 4 logon ma “wah” “wah” krwani ha ye keh k k ma GIKI ma parhta hu tou : \n\nWelcome to the Squid Games, GIKI edition. May the odds be ever in your GPA’s favor.\n",

            "Lol. Don't delete this post, will see how you stand by this in 5 years time. Seems like the poster is a kid still figuring out what to do. You must be a pussy recent grad or a student who wants vibesss: bachiyan nahi hain cafes nahi hain; LUMs buhut cool hai. Beta zara apnay kisi senior say pucho jo lums gya ho. \n\nEverything you experience in GIKI will help you in ways you wont imagine. The 1st point is the only one i agree with, that too partially. \n\nI have a gpa below 3, did an engineering deg thats not relevant to the market, worked in 3 MNCs, studied in top class boarding institutes, all my life. Still owe a lot to the experiences in giki that built me to what I am today. \n\nThe best thing about giki is the freedom; you wont get it anywhere else. Societies in giki work like small startups, liasion works like sales and cold calling, sponsorships work like vendor meetings, concerts&teams work just like being a manager, managing and raising finance for an event is real world shit companies do. \n\nThe parhai you do, the grind you get makes you adaptable and resilient: a trait loved in the industry for gikians. Lums iba kay bachay industry may preferred is liye hain because they study mgs subjects. Giki Mgs students are still preferred over them. Engineering kr kay hum lums iba kay mba bachon ki teams chala rahay hain. Babies ka comparison krna hai tou arts school jatay bro.\n\nIf youre unsure of why you chose engineering toh nahi krni thi. Mba iba ki engineering ka comparison kr lo. People went from my batch to lums and iba after engineering for an mba still make lesser money than most of us do.\n\nMy advice to you would be: Don't be a pussy, don't put shit on the wall, things are worse outside your bubble. Everything will be set in place with its time. Every org i went to gave me shit loads of preferential treatment being a gikian amongst tens of Lums iba and nust grads: ALL because of the legacy giki/gikians have built through resilience and hard work. \n\nEveryone will settle down, some later than others; times like these seem toxic/dead but thingss are way way bad outside.",
            "Tbh, I understand you. I went to Giki last year and abandoned that place after spending at most 3 or 4 days there, it's true that if you come from a secure household, you are not going to find Giki amusing at all",
            "Say alhamdulillah and move on, and maybe grow up a little, I've always found GIKI life much less exciting that literally anything else I've experienced but I still appreciate it for what it is because jab asli duniya mein jaoge you might or might not have it much worse :) this mentality will crush your tiny little heart.\n\nBe grateful for what you have, regardless of it's flaws giki is one of the best you'll have in Pakistan beta zara UET ke hostel mein survive karke dikhao not saying this is something you should accept and man up, rather it's a reality that we unfortunately have to accept, give a hand to actually make a change or shut your mouth",

First of all, it is haram to have female friends, and I don’t understand why you would want that, bro. Have some shame and stay away from such things. These friendships and relationships will affect your marriage.\nI have a problem with boys and girls who get into dating and relationship-type situations. If you are in a relationship, then please marry that person. The real problem starts when these boys and girls marry someone innocent whose past is not like theirs.

The administration should reconsider and acknowledge the long-term benefits of retaining the Faculty of Engineering Sciences.",

        "body": "A heart-wrenching incident occurred at\nGhulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI), where the 7-year-old son of a professor was found dead in a forest drain (نالا) reportedly infested with wild boars. According to the Rescue1122 report, the child had severe bite marks and injuries consistent with a wild animal attack. But this tragedy raises more questions than answers, and we, as the student community and public, deserve clarity.\n\n⚠️ Critical Questions That Must Be Answered:\n\n1. Why would a 7-year-old child wander into an uphill forest drain (marked pink area) far from his home and the school route?\n\nThat area is known to be jungle-like and is not near any children’s playground, school, or common path.\n\nWho was responsible for his supervision and how was the child allowed to stray so far unnoticed?\n\n\n2. Where was campus security?\n\nNo guards or fencing were placed near that dangerous zone.\n\nIf wild boars are known to inhabit that area, why wasn’t it cordoned off?\n\n\n3. Why wasn’t action taken when students raised alarms earlier?\n\nDuring the LDS “Showdown” event two and a half months ago, students directly informed the admin about wild boars climbing hostel stairs to dig through trash.\n\nWhat concrete steps did the admin take after that? Were these warnings ignored?\n\n\n4. Where is the video surveillance footage?\n\nHostels have cameras in almost every corridor.\n\nAre there no CCTV cameras in the faculty residential area? If not, why?\n\nWas there no effort to trace the child’s movements through surveillance footage?\n\nIf there is footage, why has it not been made public?\n\n\n5. Was the area not searched earlier?\n\nIf the drain was so close to residential blocks, how did it take so long to find the child’s body?\n\nWhy was there no immediate and organized search across natural hazard zones on campus?\n\n\n6. What is the GIK administration hiding?\n\nWhy has the administration remained largely silent and unaccountable?\n\nWhy hasn’t there been a transparent, independent inquiry announced yet?\n\n\n7. What policies does GIK have in place for wild animal threats?\n\nWhat’s the standard operating procedure (SOP) when wild animals are reported on campus?\n\nHave any actions been taken in the past to mitigate such risks?\n\n\n\n⚠️This is not just a tragic accident. This is negligence.\n\nA child has lost his life—possibly due to preventable causes like negligence in campus safety, poor wildlife control, and ignored warnings. Students and faculty must demand accountability, transparency, and real change.\n\nWe cannot let this be swept under the rug.",

            "GIK Administration should be ashamed of their negligence. Wild boars are present everywhere in the premises and they dig everything even in the backyards of residences. THE ADMINISTRATION should have taken an action before this tragic incident",
            "i think they should do a postmortem because i doubt its just an animal that did this maybe the animal came after but to be found in that area a 7yo kid there idk, how did that kid get there in the first place this doesnt seem right",
            "We know that jackals and boars attack only if provoked so i do believe the little kid saw the animals, got scared and ran, ended up falling into the drain and died upon impact and then these animals attacked the dead body. \n\nRegardless the administration should be held accountable for their negligence and should have the area fenced and have wildlife protection evacuate the animals. University going students may be able to stay away and defend themselves if need be but a kid wouldn’t know any better. \n\nBeing a residential campus with faculty and kids in the area they need to have better security measures in place. This was preventable. It’s so sad to see such a loss. May Allah grant the soul a place in paradise and give the parents the strength to bear the loss.",
            "The guards are the ones least at fault, Its almost impossible to stop or kill a wild boars. Also to give family privacies in residential areas, it may be a policy to have minimum guards . Rather, it is a structural problem with GIKI or SOPREST. They could have/should have/ *will probably do*, done three things: \n\n1. Seal crack in their walls and barriers where boars originate (jackals are harmless). PREVENT   \n2. Have more frequent and thorough boar culling hunts (they have those in the summer each year and while I personally, don't like them , they are necessary to stop huge, wild, omnivorous pests). STOP\n3. Have a thorough cameras and control systems integrating those. \n\nThe facts are clear: this is due to longstanding policies and failures. GIKI and ,more importantly its financial daddy ,SOPREST is culpable. They have blood on their hand, \n\nThere was an incident in 2019-2020 when I was attending. There was a huge boar hunt (with spears, hunting dogs and hunting people  ) and the carcasses and blood were visible. A lot of people made a fuss about it being barbaric and inhumane) I did too; I do not do so now.\n\nFor comparison: NUST, IIUI, and some other universities are larger than GIKI. They also adjoin boar areas but these are rarely a problem.  GIKI and ,more importantly its financial daddy ,SOPREST are culpable. Show us where the highly inflated fees are going.",
            "This has been going on for along time at GIKI. Animals roam freely in the hostels of girls and boys . Sometimes the security guards just let it be as it is not even something new to them . JUST NORMAL. \nBoars and jackals are a norm there \n\nTo all those applicants applying here and are even considering coming to GIKI. Keep this in mind. The administration won't take care of this issue . Period.",
            "It's deeply saddening to hear this. I had assumed the incident happened outside the campus, but knowing it occurred within the campus is truly alarming. All this time, I believed these boars were harmless so this tragedy raises serious concerns.",
            "Anyway what matters is he died, he shouldn't have had, ppl will pay, there's a guard post right where he was, this is due to negligence of the guard, and this is extremely tragic, even if they take security measures now, hwy did it have to take a death for them to do so?",

Concert aur Rave Culture\n\nSab se pehle concert aur rave culture ki baat kar li jaye to isi ne bacho ke imaan ko kharab kiya hua hai.  \nBohat aam si misaal doon ga, kabhi gaur kiya ke **masjid ki access free hai** aur **Allah aapko din mein 5 martaba bulata hai**, magar **taqreeban 2500 students ki university mein sirf max 4 safain hi puri hoti hain**?  \nDusri taraf, **concerts free nahi hote** magar hum janwaron ki tarah wahan bhaagte hain.  \nAur agar aapka **zameer zinda hai** aur **thodi si sharam baqi hai**, to sirf yehi baat aapko rokne ke liye kaafi hogi ke **jin concerts ke aap paisay bhar ke jaate hain, unhi ki loud music ki awaaz masjid ke andar tak aati hai**.  \nMaine reference ke liye ek video post kru ga.\n\n# 2. Masjid aur Admin ki zimmedari\n\nAdmin ko bhi ye baat samajhni chahiye ke jab in se kaha jata hai ke **masjid ke speakers theek karwa dein** (kyunki **azan ki awaaz hostel 3 se aage jaati hi nahi**), to **unke paas waqt nahi hota**,  \nmagar **concert ki awaaz 1 km door se masjid tak aani chahiye?**\n\n# 3. Ramadan aur Roza\n\nRamadan aa raha hai, **Allah ke waste apne rozay kharab mat kariyega**.  \nMaine note kiya hai ke **GIKI mein larkay larkiyan** (GF/BF ya simple friends, **halan ke aisi koi cheez hoti hi nahi**) **sehri aur iftari** aur hatta ke **roze mein bhi saath ghoomte phirte hote hain**.  \n**Roze ka asal maqsad seekhein**:\n\n* **Taqwa** (yani **gunahon se bachna**, jaiz aur najaiz **nafsani khwahishat** se door rehna).\n* **Gali galoch aur buri baton se bhi bachna**, warna roza nahi, sirf **faqa** hoga. Aur ye sab **sirf Ramadan ke liye nahi**, **balke poori zindagi ke liye hai**.\n\n# 4. Gali Galoch ka Mahaul\n\nJab bhi main **campus mein ghoom raha hota hoon**, mujhe **har jagah se gali galoch ki awaazain sunai deti hain**.  \nYani **jab koi baat kar raha hota hai**, to **meaningful baat kam aur galiyan zyada hoti hain**.  \n**Please is se parheiz karein!**\n\n# 5. Sohbat Aur Drug Culture\n\nApni **company wisely choose karein**. **Drug culture** se bachein aur **aise doston ka intekhab karein jo aapka imaan behtar karein, na ke barbad**.  \nBas **\"Mustafa Amir qatal case\" ko Karachi mein dekhein**,  \nAgar **thora investigate karein**, to maloom hoga ke **aap ki sohbat kis tarah aapko tabaah kar sakti hai**.\n\n**Assalam o Alaikum, wa rehmatullahi wa barakatuhu!**",

        "body": "I was there the night Jibrael went missing, the darkest night of GIKI. Along with my friends, I joined the search around 11:30 PM. We looked through the boys' hostels, grounds, and anywhere we thought he could be. Around 1 AM, we had heard that he was last seen from camera footage near the faculty hostels.\n\nWe rushed there, dozens of students, some rescue workers, all searching desperately. We combed through the mountain track behind the hostel for nearly two hours, but found nothing.\n\nAround 2 AM, the Director of Security, along with some police, local staff including a bus driver, and a few residents, headed up the same track. By 2:30 AM, they found his body.\n\nWhat struck me the most and still haunts me was that despite seeing our lecturers, professors, HoDs, the Dean, even the Pro-Rector gathered there, not one of them took initiative. Over 50 people stood there. Most students, some faculty and there was no plan, no direction. Some faculty looked on in silence; others, disturbingly, just watched as if it were a spectacle.\n\nWe searched in pitch darkness using only our mobile flashlights. There were no lights, no proper gear, no proper protocols to find a bit of stability in the time of panic. Rescue 1122 arrived around midnight, and the police didn’t show up until 2 AM , despite being contacted repeatedly since 7 or 8 in the evening.\n\nThe saddest truth is this: if blame must be placed, then it lies on all of us. The parents, faculty, staff, security, even myself because collectively, we failed to bring Jibrael back alive.\n\nBut more than blame, what hurts is the sheer lack of preparedness. There was no emergency protocol, no leadership, no system in place.Nobody tried to console and ease the pain of the father when he was in shock, thinking if he will ever get to see his son’s warm smile ever again; what is the point of pursuing and teaching the finest higher education when we never learned humanity and empathy? And when those who are meant to teach us leadership, our professors, stood frozen, what lesson does that leave behind?\n\nJibrael is a \"shaheed\", and I pray Allah spared him any suffering. But his family now carries a pain for life.\n\nMay Allah give them sabr and grant Jibrael the highest place in Jannah.",

            "Lmaoo it's true tho...especially about new \"teachers\" from comsats, etc. being employed. These teachers just read off slides. It's a major problem in GIKI...they find people who just happen to teach because they specialise in the field when they have no talent what so ever in teaching. \n\nThe thing about concerts is also true...in ur 1st year u might go to every concert and enjoy them but later on you'll realise its a waste of money (unless u get tickets for free) and start being selective about which concerts to go to. \n\nSociety culture is top-notch tho...much better than other unis.\n\nEdit: the slides stuff happens in almost every uni and with GIKI being so competitive at the end it's a matter of how good u can self study",
            "Batch of 2019 here. Everything this post says is pretty much true except for a few things. \n\nMany of the competent professors have left, but a lot of them are still there. Some of the younger professors I took classes with were exceptional. While some of the older more experienced were pretty much useless. In the end, you can't really do anything about that at any university except give it your all at self-study. \n\nFor the food thing, the cafes do get crowded, but most people just get food on the go. Those that have the time to sit and eat mostly prefer to go the tuc where there are more restaurants. You can also go off-campus to Topi 5 mins away to eat local cuisine. Was never an issue the entire time I was there.\n\nConcerts? Uni admissions mein woh kon consider karta hai? 20 mins late jao toh koi ticket bhi nahi maangta free entry hou jaati hai. And all the art deco this post says you have to do, is for the society people. Freshmen se le kar seniors sab woh kartay thay I remember. Everybody picks up the load when you have a social for a national event.\n\n\nMullah culture was there haan, but they never bother anyone else. Har tableegh se pehlay yes they used to come and invite people, but that was it. Woh toh yahan Lahore mein bhi ghar ghar aatay hain. Atleast wahan tameez se hota tha yeh.\n\nAll this said, living on your own with a lot of different kinds of people teaches you a lot. It makes you so much more independent than you can imagine. Haan GIKI has its cons, but the pros outweigh them. 🤷🏽‍♂️",

            "He is clearly yapping and exaggerating",
            "Class of 2019 here, and in my opinion, what he is saying is mostly true. Funnily enough, most of the things about faculty, academics, and facilities were true back in 2015, too, like the café got sealed and then renovated. They just started taking a lot of students in as they made new hostels. The faculty was from local universities because they couldn't attract experienced professors, etc.\n\nI mostly discourage people from going there if they are not confident in their people skills and can't survive alone, as that can happen very easily.\n\nEveryone living on campus 24/7 can be a double-edged sword.\n\nThe Topi city is very small as it is only a Tehsil of Swabi, so there are not many things to do, which can be frustrating at times, as opposed to having your university in a big or even medium-sized city. Also, because everyone has to live within the campus, there are not many things the locals have invested in for students.\n\nThe management and administration at GIKI are only interested in making money. They say they don't make a profit or lose money when people criticize them on anything.\n\nMost of the positive developments are initiated by students, not the university itself, which merely takes credit for everything.\n\nThey are incapable of running even a single department of that institution in a meaningful and productive manner.\n\nThey are now investing heavily in social media, primarily on LinkedIn, which is indicative of their mindset.\n\nIf you have the financial means, I suggest you go for a year because there can be a lot to gain. Trust me, you will find your community in that heavenly hell hill house.\n\nAfter college, you will need to study independently. No one cares about your personal choices. Whether you pass or fail, pray or not, eat junk food or healthily, or engage in substance abuse, it is of no concern to anyone. Even if someone does care, they are likely not around you. You have as much freedom as you desire, so it is entirely up to you.\n\nThe faculty can be exceptional, irrespective of their experience and résumé. Yes, there will be a lot of research papers from the experienced ones, but if you are into that, then you should definitely go there.\n\nThe food has many choices, and you will get used to it. You can always go out and eat in the nearby city. You can even travel to the Terbala Dam and enjoy local cuisines sitting right beside it.\n\nIf you have a car or a friend with a car, you can always travel to Pindi or Peshawar. It is around two hours to Pindi and two and a half hours to Peshawar. You can use public transportation too, but that will take more time and be less comfortable.\n\nIf you want to be a social butterfly, you can join societies, or you can just not bother with them at all, the same with the Tableeghi Jamaat.\nBy the way, the maulvis are nothing compared to the society people. They can be a true meance a lot of the time.\n\nDiversity is a very good thing to experience. You will get to know how people from different walks of life are so you can confirm the stereotypes yourself. 🗿\n\nEntertainment events can be hit or miss, but you can usually tell if they're worth the money by checking if you like the performer.\n\nOther events tend to lean left, as is the case in most universities, but there are guest speakers from the other side of the aisle, too.\n\nI can't say much about gyms and sports facilities, but from what I recall, they were mostly average or above average in quality.\n\nThe gaming scene is good. If you're a gamer, geek, nerd, weeb, or an otaku, you are not alone. You'll still be awkward and weird, but not alone.\n\nIf you want to study and are a bookworm, I think you will love the place. It's true too, if you're an addict 🫥\n\nJust keep these things in mind and go with your gut feeling.\n\nTLDR\nitna bura bhi nahi hai jitna lag raha hai\nItna acha bhi nahi hai jitna bataya jata hai\nMagar shugal lagay gay\npaisay hai to jao saal baad far sooch laina\nFast Karachi sa to zayada acha hi ho ga waisay\nKuch bhi nahi to adventure hi sai",
            "Bro first of all it's not worth moving to a university in another location if your city already has an education institution.

I have a BS in nanotechnology and I work in finance lol. How? Well...\n\nI got an opportunity because I put genuine effort into it and communicated that effort effectively.\n\nI have good digital literacy (not programming, although digital literacy encompasses programming) and I communicate fairly well. It's a key skill to succeed in almost all modern jobs.\n\nCommunication (Not English literacy), adaptability are the next best skills to have. \n\nAs soon as I graduated I got a job in a Pakistani company. Six months of my life wasted. \n\nSo what should have I done? My advice to myself in final year:\n\nFind a job and move abroad if you can. If you can't go abroad then get a remote job in an international company. (Applies to all students, not final-year of course. Even the Alumni are welcome to take it.) \n\nHow?\n\nThe first step is extremely important. Don't be desperate, no matter how grim things seem. There are dumber people making 10x more than you cause they ain't smart enough to doubt themselves. \n\nFocus on creating value for people. Make resources and post on LinkedIn to create a personal brand. That's one example for creating value. Still not sure? This post is another example ;)\n\nForm relationships and network. Learn to talk to people. \n\nI wasn't very social when in my university days due to a subconscious fear of rejection. Got over that by making myself uncomfortable, talking to people and girls. \n\nRemember, if something makes you uncomfortable(not distressed, the distinction is important), thats usually a sign that you're learning. \n\nSuccess is all about the mindset. Once you develop the right one, you'll get there in no time. \n\nGood luck 🤞",

That makes it more actionable and less intimidating.  \n\nThink about what you want, make steps towards it and then make conscious efforts towards it. \n\nFor me it's something like this:\n\nWatching a lecture on how to program = passive \n\nActually programming a small project (calculator for example) = active work\n\nI learned programming by trying to solve the problem in my daily life.\n\nFor example:\n\nProblem: I need to turn on my room lights when I enter the room.\n\nSolution: Got an Arduino, a led bulb and an ultrasonic sensor. Pointed the sensor at my door and programmed it to light up the LED when the door opened.",

These 2nd year students also ranted about how ragging was soo bad in our time . Phir they end up doing the same thing once they get the chance . I am pretty sure the kids getting ragged right now would rag the new batch once’s it comes .

            "Must I mention a lot of people including those who got ragged in their junior years end up romanticizing it, which promotes ragging culture even further. It's not \"ice-breaking\" or \"bonding\", it is harassment. Especially if they're going to such lengths to humiliate others. Take a look at the GIKI weekly page on Instagram and how they talk about ragging so casually as if it's part of the campus heritage you're supposed to be proud of. \n\nUnfortunately I don't think this shitty culture can be eradicated easily. This is Pakistani society. \n\nThose of you juniors who are more manly and mature than the pigs who call themselves your \"seniors\"  and treat you like circus animals during the time you need warmth and guidance the most, know that your good conscience will pay off. You have our respect. \n\nThe rest of you hypocrites, keep parroting your religious verses and justifying your wrongs, knowing fully well how much distress your actions cause for your juniors who only treat you with respect. One day you will face your own shadow.",

Max they’ll take you to their room (which is rare), but nothing that actually ruins someone’s respect. Most of it is just to get to know each other. That’s not “ragging,” that’s ice-breaking , learn the difference first.\n\nSo OPINION REJECTED. It’s literally been 3 weeks;  you can’t judge an entire university experience in that time. A lot more is yet to come, and people literally fight to get into GIKI because of the events, opportunities, and culture here. I’m not saying GIKI is perfect there are numerous problems ,but looking at it from the outside doesn’t qualify you to talk like you’ve lived it.",

I’m not even joking, I felt like throwing up.\n\nGuys, please take personal hygiene seriously. In summer, just showering and wearing clean clothes isn’t enough. Use a roll-on, deodorant stick, or even a basic perfume. You don’t need anything fancy like Tom Ford or Creed, cheaper options work just fine. You’re all grown adults. If not for yourself, at least be considerate of others.\n\nOnly the mature ones will understand this. The rest might get offended or make fun of it and that speaks for itself.\n",

        "body": "‼️‼️A CHILD MAULED TO DEATH INSIDE GIK INSTITUTE‼️‼️\n\nA 6–7 year old child was found dead in a sewer, having been eaten by wild boars that roam freely within the campus.\n\nThis is a horrifying and deeply tragic incident. It is also the direct result of a complete failure on the part of GIK’s Security Department and Administration.\n\nWild animals capable of killing and consuming a human being were moving around inside campus grounds, and there were no measures in place to prevent such a disaster. No fences. No surveillance. No response.\n\nThe question is simple: What exactly is our security department doing?\n\nThey seem fully capable when it comes to:\n– Checking if students have ACs in their rooms\n– Policing car movement inside campus\n– Stationing guards on roundabouts\n– Monitoring couples\n\nBut when it came to a real and deadly threat, they were absent. They could not handle the presence of dangerous wild animals. They failed to protect an innocent child.\n\nThis was not an accident. This was preventable.\n\nThe average age of the security staff is over 50, many are retired military personnel, and in an actual emergency, they could not even manage basic animal control — let alone a serious breach of campus safety.\n\nThe administration has been completely silent.\nNo public statement. No responsibility. No visible action.\n\nThis campus is not a military playground. It is a university. People live here. Families visit. Students walk around day and night. We deserve to be safe.\n\nImagine — truly imagine — what that child went through. Alone. Afraid. In pain. That could have been a student. A sibling. A visitor. It could have been anyone.\n\nWe cannot let this be brushed aside.\n\nI urge every student to:\n\t1.\tAsk your parents to call the GIK administration directly.\n\t2.\tDemand accountability for what has happened.\n\t3.\tForward this message to every relevant student group.\n\t4.\tEnsure this reaches the media if no action is taken.\n\nThis is not just about anger — it is about safety, responsibility, and justice.\n\nIf this tragedy does not wake up the administration, then nothing will.\n\nLet it be known: if they stay silent, we will not.",

        "body": "Tldr; I've caught my roommate \"choking his chicken\" twice now. What should I do?\n\nAt first, my roommate seemed like a decent guy—smart and someone who mostly kept to himself. But lately, things have become very weird. I have no idea how long it’s been since he last showered; the room constantly reeks of a piss smell (no joke), and I have to use air freshener every hour just to cope with it.\n\nThe first time I caught him was last Tuesday, right after my CH class. I walked in and found him in the middle of \"the act\", with tissues and Vaseline on his bed. I left immediately and went to GIKafe, hoping he'd get it together before I came back. But when I returned half an hour later, he was acting like nothing happened—no embarrassment at all. I even brought back some rolls, and he casually joined me like everything was normal. I don’t mind sharing food, but the situation made me extremely uncomfortable. Honestly, I think he does it at night too, because I’ve heard those gross sloshy noises more than a few times.\n\nThen, last night, I caught him again after I got back from Tuc, and this time, he had the audio on while watching. I don’t know what kind of kink he’s into, because clearly anyone standing just outside the door could hear the audio. At this point, I just want to change my roommate, but I’m not sure who to report this to. I can’t deal with this for the rest of the year.\n\nP.S.: If you’re reading this, please learn some basic etiquette and get help!!\n\nEdit: I tried talking to him after my morning class and he literally said \" lrke krte hn ye sb, tumne kabhi muth nhi maari? room change krana h tou kralo\". I am definitely going to report to Sabahat. ",

        "title": "A smoll guide",
        "body": "Congratulations to all of you who got admission to GIKI. Hope everyone is excited for the new journey. \nI've recently been reading everyone's concern about the lack of orientation efforts by the admin and students and I totally understand that, ngl mere Apne time mein bhi Kuch khas nae thi,  I personally can't do anything about this so I thought the least  I could do is share my experiences and lessons I learnt the hard way which maybe some of you could benefit from. \n\nPehle Kuch FAQs address kerlete Hein.\n- Hostels and campus life:\n                                             The hostels given to male freshmen are hostels 11 and 12. In hostels mein you have communal washrooms and each floor has two corridors jinke end per washrooms hotay on each side, don't worry you won't ever have to hold it for long 🙂 the cleanliness of the washroom depends on the people using those washrooms toh agar apki luck achi howi and you get people who care about hygiene toh you won't really have a problem and they do get cleaned regularly.\nThe room that you'll get allotted will have most of the basic stuff, a bed with a mattress and a pillow, a table that has a drawer with a lock, a shelf above the table and a medium sized wardrobe enough to hang and store your seasonal clothes and bags. Room mein radiators bhi hotay but mere time per they never turned on but I think that's changed now. You will probably need a small electric heater in the peak winter. You will have a roommate for the first two years, second year mein jab hostel change hongay toh you can ask for a specific roommate ofc.\nHostel keh second or fourth floor per common rooms hotay jinme AC chal raha hota and has a smoll tv too, so if you ever wanna chill between classes toh hostel ka common room is not the worst option.\nFor guys, laundry kayliye tuc per iek shop Hy Joh week mein 2-3 dafah laundry lene or dene atay, rates are normal but I would suggest keh humesha kapray dete Howe count your clothes cause kabhi kabhi lala sy kapray misplace hojatay, I have lost a few of my clothes that way 🥲. You can get yourself surf and small tub to wash your socks and undergarments yourself too but uska itna time nae milta. \n\n- Food:\n            You get multiple options for food which are okay honestly. Mainly you get 3 options\nUnlike Nust and some other universities, apka Mess isn't in the hostel itself, you need to go the central Mess that isn't really far. Mess ka khanay is okay, you won't probably like it shuru mein cause it's a huge shift in taste but it is relatively cheaper, do make sure to keep a proper record of your mess attendance, apko iek register per mess In ya out kerna hotay, just take a picture of that page in case you ever need it in the future cause mess Walay aksar charge you extra meals. You get charged separately for breakfast and lunch or dinner iek Sath hotay.\nYou won't get charged for breakfast if you don't do it even if apka Mess in Hy. Lunch or dinner mein sy kek bhi agar ap kerte toh you'll get charged for both. Mess in or out ap mostly kabhi bhi kersaktay but Kuch din jab menu mein koi ayesi chez ho which is served a specific quantity per person, us din apko timely in kerna hota, if I'm not wrong before 10 am. Baqi mess keh rules and policies lala explain kerdenge. It's a good/okay option overall.\nSecond option is the Giki-Cafe which is below the auditorium, food there is good and prices are okay as well, you can get thoray bohat snacks as well from there. The only downside to it is keh at rush hours it's hard to find a place there ya phir the food is finished lekin if you come at a good time toh you would probably never face these issues.\nThird option tuc Hy and tuc ka Khana is good but it a little expensive sometimes. The fast food is not the best but it's not bad either. Plenty of options to explore. \n\n- Academic life:\n                           Most probably ap giki perhne kayliye hi arahay so let's go over some basic things overall perhayi keh lihaz sy. One of the biggest differences for me was keh there's a huge difference between semester system and annual, most probably abhi tak you went through your matric/fsc and O/A levels jisme if u didn't study shuru mein toh ap aksar chezin cover kerlete thay end mein. Semesters are not like that, it's just 4 months that pass by really quick, after the first two months Apke mids hongay and then two months after that finals and I'm between quizzes or assignments which all contribute to your grade. You also get a project depending on the course after the mids which counts for your grade as well, I'll try to attach a general breakdown of the weightage of everything but it's varies from instructor to instructor, they'll share everything during the first week.\nThe easiest way to get a good gpa is to make sure you put in the effort shuru sy, make sure you get good marks in your quizzes and assignments. Assignments har koi aksar copy kerta lekin if you try to do it yourself and on time toh Apke quiz ki tayari bhi hojati cause assignments keh Baad aksar ussi syllabus ka quiz hota. Agar apke quizzes or assignments achay jarahay Hein toh eventually you'll get good marks in the mids and the finals.\nRelative grading might be a new thing to a lot of students, and it's not really a bad thing. In a nutshell, your marks can be considered good if you are above the average marks scored in that exam/quiz, which obviously means you scored more than most of the people. Apne Koshish yeh kerni keh you don't fall below the average ever. The position relatively to your entire class is what determines your grade for the course and also depends a bit on the nature of the instructor keh woh Kesi grading kerte. \nOverall agar perhayi mein apko koi masla ata Hy toh I would suggest to respectfully approach your instructor at a suitable time and address them the issues you're facing, koi Orr student apko us Tarah guide nahi kersakta and not everyone wants to as well.\nMost instructors are nice enough to help you out. \nTry not to miss your quizzes and submit your assignments on time, assignments keh free keh number hotay so don't waste that extra 2-4%.\nTry your best to get a good gpa In your first two semesters kiunke Baad mein it's relatively hard to improve your cgpa...\nEach course has a specific number of credit hours allotted to it.\nThe allowed number of absentees depend on the credit hours, you're allowed 9,6,3 absentees for a 3,2,1 credit hour course respectively. I'm not gonna get in the details but a higher credit hour course has a greater weightage on your grade as well so prioritize getting a good grade in the 3 credit hour courses cause they can make and break your gpa. Baqi try to make sure you exceed the allowed absentees for your course, some instructors don't mind a few extra absentees but it's best you stay within the allowed limit warna you won't be allowed to sit in the final exam of that course and you could say goodbye to getting a good grade.\nBaqi personally I would suggest keh instructors ki good books mein raho, it won't make a huge difference in any way lekin apko potentially faida bhi hosakta Hy in a lot of ways.\n\nAlso try to setup your profile on LinkedIn as well, keep it updated. It's a good professional platform that will help you in the longer run.\n\n\n- Ragging:\n                 Speaking from a guy's perspective, ragging giki mein hoti Hy seedhi baat Hy, 90% of the time the seniors doing the ragging, do it to break the ice. It's not a Bad thing honestly. No one will ask you to do anything physical at any public place, seniors keh rooms jaoge toh alag baat Hy and whatever happens there could range from measuring the floor using a coin to limits you don't wanna know. \nMy advice would be to be respectful to your seniors no matter what as long as they don't force you to do anything ya get physical. Agar koi masla ho toh just walk away and report it to the admin.\nFor some societies, apko join kerne kayliye you have to give an informal interview which is another name for ragging. \nIt really depends on how far are you willing to go or apki boundaries kia Hein. One of the good things about ragging is keh seniors Khana khila dete ragging keh Baad aksar 😀.\nBaqi mein zayada nae Bata raha kiunke mene khud bhi kerni Hy 😉.\n\n\nNow a few personal suggestions from my experiences over the two years I've spent here. Yeh baatein saari subjective hongi and depend on the sorta person you are.\n\n- Hostel life is not easy, it's necessary for every adult imo, apko ab tak ghar per Joh comfort Mila that all is gonna change, now as an adult you'll be responsible for your diet, laundry, studies, hygiene, social life, entertainment etc. Make sure to use this opportunity to grow as a responsible adult.\n- Societies and teams: you'll get bombarded with a lot of seniors iek time per who'll try to convince you to join their societies cause uske beaghair ap kia hi keroge in that jungle, that's not entirely false lekin you could do a lot with a couple of good friends. Society ka iek faida yeh Hy keh apka Apne batchmates or seniors keh Sath iek acha social circle banjata and it's an easy way toh build a social circle. Baqi koi khas faida nae, it's mostly stupid kaam and zalalat. But again it's entirely up to the sort of person you are and what your priorities are. For some people,  societies end up ruining their academic life but for some Joh smartly manage kerte sab it's doesn't really effect them.\nSocieties ka future mein Kuch khas faida nae, no recruiter is gonna look at your CV and think \"is banday ny society ka event acha kerwaya tha toh islye isko nokri dedun\". Yes sure it does help you build a better personality and build your people-skills but it's nothing you can't learn in other ways. What would actually benefit you are teams, join a team relevant to your faculty and Usme you'll get much more knowledge, experience and even opportunities.\n\nI tried to keep it short and to the point lekin clearly I failed, if you have any other questions ya concerns toh feel free to ask.\nP.S I'm not an expert, everything I wrote was solely based on my experiences.

        "title": "So you're a freshman at GIKI now.",
        "body": "Congratulations you got into GIKI.\n\nWelcome aboard.\n\nNow I am gonna tell you some things that I wish someone told me in my first semester. \n\nYou're of course welcome to ignore it or take bits that you find useful.\n\nFirst things first, academics. Some of you might've heard, but for those of you who don't know, GIKI is notorious for fucking up your GPA. And if you're aspiring for a scholarship abroad, you can kiss it goodbye if you don't have more than 3.3 graduating CGPA (3.5+ is ideal).\n\nLook it it from a foreign university's perspective. For them all Pakistani universities are the same. They don't care if you've graduated from GIKI or Iqra or virtual university. And for them, a person with a 4.0 from virtual university is more valuable as compared to someone with a 3.2 from GIKI.\n\nI don't wanna scare you, just want to prepare you for what's coming. At GIKI the GPA odds are stacked against you. Odds are that whatever your CGPA is in your first year, you're graduating on that CGPA. \n\nAgain, I cannot overstate the importance of your first year's CGPA. Now I know that for most of you, this is the first time that you're far from home. You might be homesick or don't have any friends. All those problems aside, you HAVE to focus on your academics. \n\nYou have to go to every class and lab, especially labs. If you miss them then you're not gonna get those marks and that can result in loss of grades. Plus it's the first time that you're gonna perform an experiment and record your findings in a manual. Trust me I've graduated and even I don't wanna go through first year's labs again. Focus extra hard on PH and MT. \n\nThere's a very real possibility that you're gonna fail a course in two consecutive semesters and flunk out of the university. Or that you might have to take summer school (Pay outrageous amounts per credit hours, attend classes while feeling that you're living in an oven and have no social life whatsoever), or you have to spend an extra year at the university to get your degree.\n\nA more probable scenario is that you graduate with a low CGPA. Imagine all your friends, all your peers going abroad for a masters, getting jobs in a multinational company and you're left behind because of your low CGPA. Imagine graduating at a 2.9 CGPA. And that is gonna be you if you don't get a good CGPA in your first year.\n\nMake a habit of doing practice problems in the book daily. Try solving the assignments by yourselves. Study for your quizzes and make a habit of being to places on time.\n\nAt least for your first year forget societies and teams or any other activity that takes time away from academics. \n\nOf course that doesn't mean that stop having fun altogether. Socialize with people, but please stay away from people who want you to try drugs or smoking. Peer pressure is a real thing and you might just be trying to fit in, but trust me, these people are gonna be poison for you in the long run. You're gonna learn to identify toxic people and stay away from them. \n\nTalk to people, go to office hours and introduce yourselves to your instructors (one of them might be your FYP advisor), talk to the opposite gender and try to make friends, visit topi bazar, explore inside and outside of the university or book a trip to Peshawar on the weekend.\n\nAll in all your focus should be on getting as near to 4.0 as you can for the first two semesters. \n\nAs for the next year, we'll you'll figure it out. Who knows I might make another post about it in the future. \n\nCiao for now.\n\nEdit: To clarify some things because I realised that I didn't list the reasoning behind why you should focus heavily on  academics in the first year.\n\nYour first year's CGPA contributes the most towards the calculation of your overall CGPA. As semesters pass, your semester GPA contributes significantly less towards your CGPA. So that's why your first semester GPA is really important. This also means that bouncing back from a low GPA is really tough.\n\nAs someone who has applied for a lot of scholarships, to foreign universities, every university in Pakistan, or every third world country is the same to someone reading your application from a first world country. If you're hoping that GIKI's name is gonna get you into places, you're in for disappointment.\n\nEven to companies (domestic and foreign) the university doesn't really matter. What matters is the environment that you've been exposed to, how much of it do you manage to take in and groom yourself (i.e. improve your communication and competency). And you should do that in your second and third year. But right now, focus on your academics.",

            "All the freshers reading this should be grateful, this is some valuable information that will literally shape your journey for the better. Please do not risk your GPAs ever! Every quiz and assignment matters.\n\nJust one thing, your first year GPA doesnt necessarily contribute the most. But chances are that you may hit extremes in your first year i.e higher highs or lower lows, in which case it can create a huge impact, otherwise it has the same contribution as the rest of the 3 years, and you can end up improving or worsening your CGPA.",
            "Thank you very much",
            "This is mostly BS. Lot of people will not have great first year GPA cause it takes time to figure things out. Many of them will eventually bounce back. \n\nForeign universities don’t just look at your CGPA. Someone with 4.0 from Iqra or Shagufa university is not better than you. \n\nAlso you’re not going there just to buy a GPA. Build social connections. Have fun. Learn some street smarts. Find a balance. You’re not doomed if you’re under 3.3.",

            "Most of this is pure BS.\n\nI agree to the fact that your academics are important but dont stress over them to the point that you start getting anxiety. GIKI is hard but OP has literally over exaggerated everything. Give everything time and take it slow. Take part in extra curriculars and join societies/teams. You just need to keep everything balanced. \n\nAt the end of your degree GPA will be important but of equal importance will be the skills you learned from societies etc and yes they do play a part in getting admission abroad and getting good jobs.\n\nEnjoy your time here, and stay miles away from people whose only job is to make you stress over academics.",
            "Ngl, that foreign gpa part is true, although I don't believe in the rest op mentioned.",
            "No, honestly that part is very true. Foreign companies, universities don't keep a list of all good universities in Pakistan. As long as that university is in Pakistan, it is just a \"Pakistani university\" nothing more than that. However for Pakistani employers they will keep note of which Pakistani university you're from.",
            "Nanotech.",
            "Most top tier universities do their homework when inducting students. They know which university in Pakistan stands where. They know that GPA is a subjective measure comparatively. \n\nAlso what would sound more believable? 50 applications from a low tier university all of them above 3.5 or 20 applications from giki with a decent GPA spread?\n\nThere’s plenty of giki alumni that end up in Ivy League colleges at below 3.5. Never met anyone from Iqra ever making the cut.",
            "Would you suggest the same for MGS student ?",
            "Idk about iqra, but I've heard of one of my cousins from ucp, getting in Germany for masters (dunno his gpa) but I know of another relative who didn't do well in LUMS, had like a 2.9 gpa; and neither could he apply abroad. \n\nTo be really honest, institutions abroad will still not glorify LUMS,giki as much as we Pakistanis glorify them. Universities abroad may not appreciate very unknown universities like iqra, minhaj. But they may consider popular universities in Pakistan like ucp; even tho to us ucp is not a great institution still according to google ucp is very well known and has a decent rating with apparently good facilities. Even tho we Pakistanis know very well that ucp is not that great. That's the \"homework\" universities do abroad,they don't look too much into detail. \n\nDo you think they would consider LUMS,giki any better than Rutgers from New Jersey? No, in their eyes it will always be \" Any American university > Any Pakistani university\". So by the end of the day it IS your gpa, experience,skill that they'll have to prioritize more. These aren't just my opinions, I've talked to a few career counselors regarding masters and that's the conclusion I could make of.",

He got the nickname ‘cause of his build, and he was the guy everyone associated with ragging. His rep was so bad that when batch 31 heard he was coming back to complete some missing courses, I literally saw a dude get goosebumps just at the mention of his name.\nHe tied up two juniors by their balls and made them do a tug of war. Whoever screamed first lost (and worst will happen to him), and he wouldn’t stop until he was “satisfied” with their performance.\nThe juniors who didnt comply with his orders he would keep them in his room for hours to days. This was not just ragging, it was mentally breaking down. There are many seniors who are mentally and emotionally challenged and can do something like this to you. So, please dont go near ragging stuff or informal shit.\nSome societies with worst informals:\n1. Sports Society \n2. Naqsh\n3. CDES\n4. Sophep",

        "body": "**Today I came across the news of a 7-year-old child’s tragic death on campus, and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it.**  \nMay Allah grant the family sabr. No parent, no sibling, no loved one deserves to go through such a loss. This wasn’t just a tragedy. This was a **preventable failure.** And we should all be angry.\n\nAs someone considering to be a part of this institution I can say this without hesitation: if my family finds out what happened, they would never send me here. And honestly? I wouldn’t be able to convince them otherwise.\n\nThat child wasn’t a visitor, he was a **resident’s child.**  \nHis family lived here. They trusted this place to be safe. That trust was broken in the most horrific way possible.\n\n**Where was the security? What are the protocols? Are there even any?**  \nAnd if the campus isn’t properly protected, what about us?  \nWe’re students , not trained officers. If we’re ever faced with danger, how are we expected to protect ourselves?\n\nI heard someone say *“the terrain is too rough for fencing.”*  \nI’m sorry, but that’s not good enough.\n\nIt’s **2025.** This is an **engineering college.**  \n**If you can build complex machines and systems to solve a problem, you can build a fence.**  \nYou can design barriers. You can implement security protocols. You can make this campus safe even if the terrain is challenging.  \nSaying *“it can’t be done”* is an excuse. It shows that **safety was never the priority.**\n\nWhat keeps haunting me is the thought of that child’s final moments. Alone. Afraid. Panicked. What was he thinking? Was he calling for help?  \nHe was just a child!!! He trusted the adults around him to keep him safe. And they didn’t.  \nThat image plays over and over in my head and it physically hurts.\n\nWe keep saying *“Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Rajioon”* and yes, we must pray. But **dua is not a substitute for accountability.**\n\nSomeone needs to take responsibility.  \nSomeone needs to answer for this.  \nThis should not end in silence or vague condolences.  \nWe should be seeing **public statements, internal investigations, a complete overhaul of campus security and yes, resignations**, if that’s what justice and safety demand.\n\nIf this incident is brushed aside, then what message are we sending?  \nThat safety is optional?  \nThat a child’s life doesn’t matter enough?  \nThat we only care for **reputation, not reform?**\n\nThis isn’t just about one institution anymore. It’s about how casually we treat **basic safety** in academic spaces.  \nIt’s about a culture of negligence, where action only happens after a tragedy and even then, it’s **temporary and performative.**\n\nWe owe that child **more than mourning.**  \nWe owe him **change.**  \nWe owe him the **promise** that this will never happen again, not to another child, not to another student, not to another resident, **not to anyone.**",

They have never threatened us before. It is a dark day for GIKI.\n\nWe hope such ab incident will never happen again. The GIKI Community is trying to mail administrations, even organize protests. But I must also urge that you should not be afraid as this was a rare occurrence.",
            "Exactly. While talking to students I realized this isn’t an isolated incident. Wild animals near the residential area have been a concern for quite some time, and the administration is aware of it. If they’re being paid to ensure safety and order on campus, it’s fair to ask why basic precautions haven’t been taken. Open drains, no fencing, and lack of wildlife control point to ongoing negligence!!!\n\n#",
            "The child was reportedly attacked by a wild boar near the residential area. During the encounter, he fell into an open nalla and died due to the impact. His body, which was found after he had been missing for some time, also had visible bite marks. It’s absolutely heartbreaking and terrifying.",
            "Try telling a grieving mother, “This was rare,” and see if it brings her son back.\n\nA child died due to negligence. It’s a hard truth, but we must confront it. Just because wild animals hadn’t attacked before doesn’t mean their presence was ever okay. That mindset failed a 7-year-old. Let’s not let it fail anyone else.",
            "You are absolutely right. Wild boars and other wild animals are seen in the premises roaming freely and digging everything even sometimes people think that we (THE HUMAN) are strangers here. No proper fencing and no proper wildlife control has been done and these wild animals started digging backyards of the residences. The residents can't even do anything because these wild animals travel in groups. Even people avoid getting out after sunset. In short everyone should be doing his/her work for which they're getting paid",

They have proper orientation groups led by seniors, campus tours, batch photos, ice-breaking sessions, and all sorts of activities that help freshies feel at home right from day one. It really makes a difference when you’re new and nervous about starting university life.\n\nBut I’ve heard from many people here that GIKI’s orientation is pretty dull and not enjoyable at all. Why can’t we change that? Why can’t our seniors and the student body work on making those first two days something memorable  something we can proudly talk about just like students at LUMS or NUST? A little fun and effort before classes start won’t hurt anyone; instead, it will set the tone for our whole experience at GIKI.\n\nIt’s not just about the orientation. Let’s be honest  when people choose LUMS or NUST over GIKI, it’s often because they see events, societies, and facilities that are more engaging and well-organized. We shouldn’t be left behind just because we don’t put enough effort into these things. As someone who will be joining GIKI this year, I really want our university to stand out in every possible way. Everyone wants to feel proud of their university  to see it at the top not just academically but also in terms of student life and campus culture.\n\n***I sincerely request our respected seniors and the Student Body Council to take this seriously and work on bringing positive changes. We freshies, and I’m sure many other students too, would wholeheartedly support any efforts to make orientation more exciting and student life more vibrant. Please make it your priority to bridge this gap between GIKI and other prestigious institutions like LUMS and IBA.***\n\nA few days of fun activities, better planning, and more student engagement won’t just benefit us  it will help future batches too and make GIKI an even more attractive choice for talented students. Seniors, we really look up to you please take immediate action and make this happen. Let’s make GIKI stand out for all the right reasons!",

My father was the one who told me my first priority is your education but when the time came the story flipped. There might be few financial crisis I totally understand I refused the offer and then later on applied to IBA but unfortunately couldn't get in. I applied to giki and got accepted for bscs, my mother was in the hospital I stayed with her day and night and I just got a day to prepare for giki test despite that I managed to clear it. When the results came out can you guess what they said?( Congratulations that you got accepted but we cannot send you). I cried in front of them but nobody listened. There wasn't a single day I betrayed my parents trust even to the extent that I don't even talk to boys but I guess it was of no use. I applied to nust and got in for mechanical engineering but my father tells me this isn't the field you should pursue. Later on my least Option was left for CS I got accepted there(I will be going there now) it's a business university particularly and not even famous. Why the hell did I went through all those struggles for clearing those university tests( agar mujhay pata hota ye hona hai mere Sath main kabhi mehmag hi nahi karti).

I'm studying for a particularly difficult test rn and I can't imagine having all my hardwork go to waste, I think I would just slime my parents if this shit happened to me and it's a shame that idiots in this comment section are defending this girl's parents for not sending their child to a good uni just because they can't send her away. Don't ask your children to study if you can't follow through with their effort PERIOD",
            "Funny how you’re stressing over 19,500 per credit hour at KSBL, which adds up to 2.65 million PKR, when many people don’t even have the *o*ptio to choose between top universities. The real issue isn’t tuition bruhh it’s the mindset that thinks love equals financial control.Stop comparing your situation to friends with wealthier parents. Real success isn’t about fancy university names or what they can pay for , it’s about making the most of what you’ve got and breaking free from these suffocating expectations.\n\nIf you’re constantly chasing someone else’s idea of success, when will you build your own life?",

If you really want to go to such top tier universities, and hell, you SHOULD go to them, cuz education is a weapon, and financial problems are there, tou many of these unis offer financial aids, especially GIKI, LUMS, IBA, FAST, waghera. Soo, if you have joined a low tier uni rn, try considering a gap year, and then join a really good uni, on FA.

            "I can relate to you a bit so here are few things I wanna say:\n1.I think the reason you were selected in GIKI and other institutions is that Allah wanted you to know and show you that you can achieve what you want.Ab aus university mein tou insan nhien jata jahan aus ny test dia hou likin insan ko apni performance say confidence ata hai and trust me it is a big thing.\n\n\n2.Money is something that we or our parents cannot control.Agar insan apney halat ko ley kay ronay lag jai tou phir tou sari zindagi aisey he guzr jai gi.Trust me, when I say I faced very very very difficult time in my life.I started complaining and I used to cry like 4-5 time a day for 3 months straight but ab mera bilkul apney halat pay roney ka dil nhien karta cause Allah blessed me in many other ways.\n\n\n3.Wherever you are going, just be confident and happy there.You are someone who cleared and even secured good marks in NUST  and GIKI.This really shows that you are a hardworking student and should trust yourself.You should take these events as a motivation for urself.There are many people jo paisay hotey bhi yeh test detay bhi nhien hain kyukay they simply can't pass.\n\n\nGoodluck to you!!!",

            "All you wanna be westerns don't understand that in the west it's not even a concept that parents will fund your higher studies, 18 and you're supposed to be on your own. Why do you think student debt is such a problem, nobody pays for their children uni fees except a very few really wealthy parents.\nIt's a privilege and you're a spoiled rotten child.\n\nAnd no I am not a boomer.",
            "Unfortunate situation you are in. My feelings of sympathy for you. This is actually kind of common. I had similar experiences. It is called gaslighting. I highly recommend to get into a therapy where a therapist could help you out in being strong in this difficult situation. There is a way out of this but you will need strong support network outside of your family. A good nonmale therapist is the best way to seek it out."

        "body": "This is not as easy as you think but is doable. Here are a few things that you should take care of in first 2 semesters in giki. \n\n1. Never take any quiz, assignment for granted. Students don't learn for first quizzes and submit assignments late. But each quiz, each assignment is significant for final grade. \n\n2. Don't rely on mid term and finals for good grades. Yes they have a good weightage but don't take other things non seriously. \n\n3. Be disciplined in hostel life. Since many of us never stayed in hostel, it can be a liberating experience with no one to tell you what to do. For first semester, make sure you follow a good balanced schedule and revise lectures everyday. DO PLAY PHYSICAL SPORTS. It is free in GIKI so do play sports.  At least 1 hour per day. Similarly try to be hygenic in a sharing room. \n\n4. Limit Screen time (non educational). Its totally fine to watch tv shows, dramas and what not but limit the screen time and distractions. Remember. Your first job at giki is to study. Everything else is secondary. \n\n5. Focus on diet, mental health and sleep. If you are unable to follow proper diet plan, make sure you eat from mess. Yes it is a set scheduled meal but it is usually balanced and will take the hassle of thinking what to eat each day out of your hands. After some months, you'll get a hold of everything \n\n6. Societies and events are big attraction but can end up taking alot of time. Don't indulge into societies until at least 2nd semester. Enjoy events on the weekend though. Again nothing matters if your GPA is not good. \n\n7. Your semester's performance (SGPA) should always be higher than your cumulative gpa (CGPA). If you don't know the difference, JUST REMEMBER THIS RULE for now. Later on you'll get to know how to calculate it etc. \n\n",

We know many of you are probably feeling homesick, and our goal is to create a positive connection between seniors and juniors. The ice-breaking activities are simply meant to help you bond with your new friends and lighten the mood with some laughter.\n\nYou'll never be alone during this – the activities involve group of juniors together, and through these shared moments, you'll connect with us as well. Over time, these bonds can turn us into mentors and guides for you. And yes, by tradition, it all ends with exchanging numbers and treating yourselves to something you enjoy.\n\nWhat not to tolerate:\n\n- Zero tolerance for physical contact.\n- No bullying, not now or later.\n- No blackmailing, ever.\n\nAdvice:\n\nThink of it as a lighthearted prank to help break the ice, and try to have fun. Don’t take it to heart or let your ego get in the way. Rest assured, whatever happens during the ragging stays there – it won't be brought up again or used to mock anyone.\n\nIf you do encounter any negativity or toxicity, feel free to reach out. My DMs are always open to help!",

            "Let me share my story..\n\nYears ago, I took giki admission test. At the time I had already secured admission in a public university (I was position holder in Federal board). I was not much serious about getting admission in giki but someone told me about 4 scholarships from NWFP government (it was NWFP back then).\n\nThere was no formal financial assistance program back then. \n\nI passed the admission test and was offered admission. When I inquired about NWFP scholarships, they told me that you have to apply for it and if you get selected they reimburse you. I also could not afford admission fee.. so I gave up on the idea and was planning to continue with UET.\n\nThen someone asked me to inform GIKI, so that the can offer my place to next one on the merit list. I took out a piece of paper and wrote a letter the rector, that I am not joining since I can't afford the fee.\n\nOne week later I received a letter from GIKI, offering full financial assistance for the first year. I had to arrange only for a small part of the admission fees. Almost 25k. \nFinancial assistance was offered only for the first year. For subsequent years it was conditional to my academic performance. I took the risk and arranged 25k. Even 25k was a big amount for me back then. \n\nLong long story short I graduated 4 years later. My academic performance was good throughout. And I have paid back the financial assistance that was offered to me. \n\nDon't get disappointed just write a letter or maybe it's email nowadays. Just let them know situation and let the nature work it out for you.",

            "I am from o/a levels and I just graduated this year from UET. \n\nI will say of all the entry tests I gave giki was the easiest in terms of tranisitioning, I think my position was around 200 I don't remember exactly what it was but it was good, so good luck, don't take a losers mentality with you.\n\nMy next tip is for all the entry tests, I personally never worked on the fsx matrix syllabus, literally went full blast on O/A levels only when it came to prep and I was able to get an admission in every university I applied. I ended up choosing UET because giki was just not affordable.\n\nNow here's some advice about after the entry tests, apply abroad, Pakistan sucks, Pakistani universities suck, the biggest mistake in my life was to stay in this wasteland, I had VERY good grades and I choose the Pakistani approach whereas people with very bad grades were able to go outside on some pretty decent scholarships, I ended up staying in Pakistan cause parents pe in paison ka booj nai daalna Tha but in hindsight, after 4 years, it's worth it, u will be able to get much more out of that.\n\nTrust me, this Rage you feel towards the entry test doesn't stop here, it's the same after you get admitted to the uni and then it's too late. So my advice is to not give up, keep applying abroad, of course take admission in Pakistan also while you're doing that but plan A must be to go abroad.\n\nThat being said giki/nust look like the best university to go to if you are to stay in Pakistan atleast from what I've heard .\nThe reason I said all this is because I remember feeling the same way you did and I just wanted to help a brother/sister out. \n\nWhatever choice you choose I hope you choose the right one, this was just my yapping, good luck.",

            "just bust your ass a last time for this. go through the syllabus. skip the \"too hard\" sections if you might. and practice a bit. I'd say maybe try OETP if you can't go hard like FUNG KIPS.\n\n\nbaki in gik phy they say is kind of conceptual as in what ALevels would offer and physics syllabus is almost same for FSc and AS. so it's all MATHS mostly u need to give yourself \"ragra\" on.\n\nIt's just for this once time and ure in. put in your best",

        "body": "Hi, I hope you all will be fine and way too excited for starting this new chapter of your life.   \n\n\nFirstly  Congratulations,  \n\n\nI am writing this post just to let you know of the things/mistakes we did in our time and how you can live your life to the max in GIKI.  \n\n\nStarting off, Please take your studies seriously atleast the first two years, Do your assignments yourself, study regularly and take each and every quiz very seriously. Apko shuru shuru mai nai nai azaadi and new environment buhat mazay ka lgay ga but dont DONT let it divert your attention. Just remember that your studies are important and \"GPA matter nahi krta\" walay hazraat se dur rehna. Your GPA matters, if not now it will soon atleast once in your life it will make you think you should have improved it when you had the chance. Lekin that doesnt mean k ap enjoy na karo prioritize everything.  \n\n\nAbout friends, Choose them carefully. these are the people who can make or break your experience. First year is always kinda experimental you meet people you ditch some, some ditch you. So don't take stuff too seriously. By the time you graduate you will only have a couple friends who you can call your actual friends. Also please dont be a snake. Har kisi se bna ke rkho and avoid taking pangay with everyone. you will never know when you need someone.  \n\n\nAbout societies, Tbh GIKI is all about the societies but once again dont let it be the only thing in your mind. You can join them in the first two years. So dont join a shit ton of them eik hi saath. Search all of them, the people, their culture and what they do actually (I joined a society because I though i will get to learn about robotics but didnt learn a thing about it XD lekin kher stayed there till I graduated). The best strategy is to Join one big society (TIER A) and an active team or one team one big society and a tier B society. For societies my recommendations would be Media, IEEE, Sophep and Naqsh (Inme se IEEE ka I can somewhat say that people are good atleast jab we handed over tab achay thay)  \n\n\nBaaki yaar, you will get to hear k giki is in village and bullshit ignore it. Haters gonna hate potatoes gonna potate.   \n\n\nThese 4 years will be the best ones of your life IA and live them to the max. ALSO DO TRY RAJU KA CHEESE SANDWICH ON THE FIRST DAY.  \n\n\np.s. feel free to ask anything regarding giki",

As far as the prep goes just buy any good entry test series from KIPS or PGC or wherever. Go through the theory books rigorously and attempt practice books as well.\n4. Understand that you are gonna have to put in effort. If you want to get into the top degrees, you 'll have to put in a few hours daily.\n5. Everything is on youtube. There is no need to join academies. Just look up facebook groups and youtube for litr any fsc topic.\n6. Think before you choose. Understand the difference between CS, DS, AI, CE, SE, Cyber. CS is more maths. DS and AI are more practical. CE is hardware. SE is more about coding and cyber is entirely separate.\n7. If you are scoring 125+ in NET you will probably get into giki comfortably.\n8. The merit scholarship is about going that extra mile. Prepare every topic. Target your weak areas. Dive into every detail. Understand stuff just dont memorise it. And most importantly, give a calm and collected test.\n",

Till this day I think it's a bullshit concept that you could become friends this way with your seniors. For centuries this wasn't a thing, neither is this a part of our culture or religion. You can make connections in a 1000 different ways and you don't need to be humiliated to do this. Plus for those who defend ragging as a way to connect deeply, it's just not worth the side effects where people have been assaulted as well. There should be a BOYCOTT of ragging, fooling, informal. \n\nIf anyone has been having issues due to ragging, let me know if I could help in anyways. I thought kay ragging has reduced in the later batches but seeing the reddit feed has opened my eyes. I'm planning to go to the admin and discuss measures against this, as a member/student of giki I feel it's everyone's responsibility to create a safer environment for everyone. \n\n\nMY ADVICE: BOYCOTT SOCEITIES WHO CONDUCT INFORMALS, MAYBE IT'S JUST FOR SHUGAL ETC BUT NOT WORTH IT, SOMEBODY WITH THE WRONG INTENTIONS CAN TAKE IT TO AN EXTREME LEVEL AND SCAR SOMEONE FOR LIFE.

GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou’ll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It’ll help in both sun and rain.

        "body": "If I said you never have to pay for events (like I did back in my day), I’d be lying—societies put in a lot of time and money and need some profit just to afford a small trip.\nBut if you pay for every single event, your wallet will dry up fast. So here’s my honest take, based on four years in GK, on which events are worth paying for and which ones aren’t. These events don’t change much year to year—the way societies run them is pretty consistent—so here’s what I’ve learned.\n1. Science marathon: great if you want to make new friends and have some healthy competition with other fellows. I met my girl there:)\n2. Splash: fk no. Its colorfest from temu\n3. Culturefest: idk. Its the first time they are doing it.\n4. Colorfest: many people say it is good but my experience is not so good with it. But if its the only chance for u to play holi in giki. It am not paying more than 1500 for it. (Keep ur cheap as shirt naqsh)\n5. Intramimes: its free so why not\n6. Concerts: before January 2026 there will be about 3-4 concerts depending on the allpaks but go only to those jin societies ki repo achi he and singer acha aya ho. Ieee, science and media best concerts krwate hen\n7. Qawali nights: Hell no. Total time waste and go only if its free.\n8. Masquerade: Go only if you have a partner \n9. Irtiqa: Best event and one of the biggest. And if u r in 2/3 year of naqsh its more fun. My best memory of giki is this event.\n\nLet me know if i missed any event and i wll tell u about my experience \n",

        "body": "Just wanted to get this off my chest  it’s kinda disappointing that GIKI doesn’t organize a proper orientation (O-week) or even a decent welcome event for freshers.\n\nEvery other top university in Pakistan, whether it’s LUMS, NUST, IBA, etc., has an O-week filled with activities to help new students adjust, make friends, and feel excited about joining. Many even follow it up with a welcome party or some sort of celebration. It really sets the tone for the rest of their university life.\n\nGIKI is charging us a massive amount in tuition expenses, but when it comes to organizing something welcoming or meaningful for new students, there’s literally nothing official. I get that there are concerts, qawalis, and sometimes raves later on... but let’s be real not everyone is into music events or night gigs. Some people prefer interactive games, orientation talks, casual social hangouts, and other ways to connect.\n\nThere should be something inclusive enough to cater to all kinds of students not just the ones who enjoy loud music and concerts. A thoughtful welcome doesn’t require a massive budget, just some genuine effort.\n\nThere should at least be a proper welcome event... Even mid-tier universities manage to pull that off.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

            "honestly i thought the same thing before coming but the first two weeks is filled with all types of events from a batch photo to cbs’ orientation day gathering, if you’re not a concert/gig person there are other societies that start pitching themselves to you in the first 2 weeks that having an orientation week on top of that just seems excessive. I remember going to this water fight called splash and so many other things. imo the only difference between the other universities and giki is that they have labelled it o week while we have not.",

Did I get cooked, also yes😊.\nHere is the stuff I remember:\n\n\n**ENGLISH**:\nthere was a yapiyapiyop eassy from which 7-8 MCQs were asked\nsynonyms and antonyms of NPC words I had to tukkamaxx\nfill in the blanks which were very easy. One I remember is: childern of unorthodox creative parents are usually tame\na) idealist\nb) elitist \nc) individualist\nd) capitalist\n(along those lines I don't remember exactly)\n\n\n**MATH**:\npretty similar to the NET maybe easier just basic questions from every chapter. If you prepped for the NET math will be fine.\n\n\n**PHYSICS**:\nphysics was random general knowledge based ig. I had an mcq about optics repeat 5 times that I tukkad so -15aura incoming. \nThere was an mcq: if Saqib is 180cm then what should be the length of a vertical mirror such that Saqib can see his full length. \na)90cm\nb)180cm\nc)60cm\nd)30cm\nI lost some braincells figuring that out.\n\n\noverall it was okay, the interface was exactly like the NET u can review them later and do any section u prefer first. The MCQs repeat quite a bit idk if it's an error or they just didn't wanna make more MCQs . Anyways I decreased the merit so thx me later. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR TEST🫡",

For your level, I would suggest learning the Vienna and the scotch game, if you like e4 as white and the London for d4.\n\nAs black carro khan is solid for 1 e4 and kings Indian is good against 1d4. Pick a few openings for some moves and focus on memorising the lines for them.\n\nI liked to play aggressively, so I played a lot of gambits. The Vienna gambit, the Stafford gambit, the Danish gambit, scotch gambit.\n\nOne thing is I dont like playing the sicilian at your level. But you gotta learn to play against it. I loved the delayed wayne gambit against it. Or learning to play the open sicilian cause I like aggressive games.\n\nSome other openings you might wana learn to play against would be the French, the Scandinavian, etc. Main lines.\n\nOnce you have your openings down, you would wanna learn some common mating patterns.\n\nThis one tells you the most basic ones\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EAHhI6IXdts?si=2F0Y_cDz4LQSNEhO\n\nTo spot them, you can do puzzles so you get good at pattern recognition. \n\nI played a lot. Maybe like 15 to 20 games a day. Analysed them to learn patterns of failure and areas of improvement. Used nibbler with lc0 to analyse my games and see what could I have done better.",

He’s already broken into a few juniors’ rooms in H10 and H8, and just recently he was seen breaking into a room in H4.\n\nOn top of that, he doesn’t just stop at doors. He’s been picking up random stuff too like clothes and utilities.\n\nSo if you see this guy around, don’t ignore him. Report him straight to your warden or guard lala nearby.\nStay alert, stay safe gng ",

But someone here mentioned that GIKI’s orientation is pretty dull and not enjoyable. Why can’t the seniors work on making it a better experience? Just something students can actually enjoy. Come on, a little fun in the first two days before classes start won’t hurt anyone. LUMS and NUST have orientation groups led by seniors, campus tours, batch pictures, ice-breaking activities, it all helps new students settle in. I’m honestly afraid of feeling disappointed during my first two days. Please, do something about it!",

            "Honestly, I was thinking the same....It came up to me recently that why people would prefer choosing LUMS over GIKI \n\nIt’s not just about the orientation. Let’s be honest when people choose LUMS or NUST over GIKI, it’s often because they see events, societies, and facilities that are more engaging and well-organized. We shouldn’t be left behind just because we don’t put enough effort into these things. As someone who will be joining GIKI this year, I really want our university to stand out in every possible way. Everyone wants to feel proud of their university to see it at the top not just academically but also in terms of student life and campus culture.\n\n***I sincerely request (our respected seniors and the Student Body Council)to take this seriously and work on bringing positive changes. We freshies, and I’m sure many other students too, would wholeheartedly support any efforts to make orientation more exciting and student life more vibrant. Please make it your priority to bridge this gap between GIKI and other prestigious institutions like LUMS and IBA.***\n\nA few days of fun activities, better planning, and more student engagement won’t just benefit us it will help future batches too and make GIKI an even more attractive choice for talented students. Seniors, we really look up to you  please take immediate action and make this happen. Let’s make GIKI stand out for all the right reasons!\n\nIAM PUTTING IT UP AS A SEPERATE POST IN THE GIKI SECTION EVERYONE PLEASE UPVOTE!  \nLETS MAKE IT HAPPEN!!",

I should have believed myself at that time, i could have taken the test seriously so i could get top 20 scholarship. i wish i could join GIKI(my dream university) this year.

        "body": "I realized that many people are not fully aware of the admission process for MS students at GIKI, so I’ve put together this guide for anyone considering pursuing their master’s degree here.\n\nGIKI offers three categories of scholarships for MS students. Every admitted student falls under one of these categories:\n\n1. GA-Ship (1 & 2)\n\nThis scholarship allows students to reside on campus (bachelor accommodation only) without paying any academic fees. In addition, GA-1 recipients receive a monthly stipend of PKR 20,000.\n\nI would recommend this scholarship primarily for students who intend to pursue a PhD. The reason is that recipients are required to work closely with professors, and in some cases may also be assigned responsibilities such as serving as a warden. Staying on campus is compulsory, and you cannot simultaneously hold another job/role while enrolled in this MS program.\n\nThat being said, GIKI has a strong reputation for research. Therefore, if you are planning to pursue a doctorate, an academic career, can live on minimal resources, and do not have major family commitments, this is an excellent opportunity. It should be noted, however, that each department typically offers only 3 to 4 GA-ships per admission cycle, twice a year.\n\n2. Day Scholar Scheme\n\nUnder this scheme, students pay a subsidized tuition fee of PKR 50,000 per semester. However, no accommodation or housing support is provided by the university administration. Classes are generally held on Fridays and Saturdays (though it is somewhat unusual that they assume students with jobs are free to attend on Fridays lol).\n\nThis option is suitable ONLY!!! for students living within commuting distance (ideally no more than an hour away) plus who may have remote part-time jobs alongside their studies. If you meet these 2 conditions, then this is an okayish opportunity.\n\nThat said, the administration does not accommodate day scholars. If you live farther awa for instance, in Rawalpindi commuting can be extremely challenging. The only nearby lodging options are quite limited: there is one hotel (Khan Guest House), which hardly qualifies as suitable accommodation, and a so called “hostel,” which is essentially a bare structure with iron windows and doors, no beds or carpets, no food service, and no internet. While cheaper (around PKR 5,000 security deposit plus PKR 5,000 monthly rent for a shared room), the living standards are very basic and just enough for a person to sleep under a roof. Moreover, the local community around Topi generally does not welcome outsiders, especially unmarried individuals or married people who don’t want to bring their spouse to Topi.\n\nOn the academic side, most faculty members are understanding of the fact that day scholars often have jobs. However, if you encounter a professor who is inflexible about attendance, managing both work and studies can become very difficult.\n\nAdmission Process: \n\nIf you are interested in applying, here is the step by step process:\n\n\t1.\tApply online through the official GIKI admissions portal.\n\n\t2.\tSend the required documents via courier as asked.\n\n\t3.\tSit for the entry test (GRE works as well). While the website mentions the GRE General, in practice the university test is closer to a GRE Subject exam combined with comprehension. Be prepared for questions involving eigenvalues, matrices, and related concepts.\n\n\t4.\tResults are announced within 3–5 days, typically via a departmental WhatsApp group (the MS management is a bit immature).\n\n\t5.\tShortlisted candidates are then called for an on campus interview. Some departments have stopped doing online interviews altogether for God knows what reason.\n\n\t6.\tThe interview lasts about 10 minutes. You are usually asked about your three favorite subjects, tested with a few related questions, and expected to briefly discuss your undergraduate final year project (FYP).\n\n\t7.\tThe final outcome: 3–5 students per department are awarded GA-ships, while the remaining candidates who pass the written test are placed under the Day Scholar Scheme. (Note: the interview generally does not affect day scholar selection.)\n\nGIKI is a good place to pursue your masters degree if you live nearby and can’t get a good job after bachelors or only plan to get into academia (then GA Ship is fine). The environment is very different from NUST/FAST. 95% of the class consists of people from closeby areas so you’ll have limited networking opportunities. You should never try being a day scholar if your commute is more than 1 hour. You will suffer like some of my classmates did.",

            "Can you please give more info about the test. I am very confused. I was preparing for this test with gre general syllabus. you said test is similar to gre subject, can you please confirm the syllabus of the test or any Info that you can give related to test like what to study and from where to study I'll be really grateful.",
            "The classes are on Friday and Saturdays only. \nIf you dont live nearby, still , its ok. \nJust one time travel per week. ",
            "The test is not that difficult, maybe the math portion is. I do know that the website states the math portion would be relevant to GRE General, but the actual test has questions out of the syllabus. Instead of wondering at that moment why the university did that, please note the following:\n\n\n1. The first portion will have a paragraph that you will have to comprehend and answer some questions related to it. This is the English Comprehension section.\n\n2. The second part is math based. You can expect: Matrices, basic integration, basic differentials, vectors, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. \n\n\nYou will need to score at least 50% combined, and there is no negative marking.",
            "No it’s not. The classes are till 8ish pm on Fridays, and commence around 9 am on Saturdays. You will have a very hard time finding a place to stay for the night and you obviously can’t travel 6 hours each week for 2 years (assuming you come from main Islamabad 1 hour 30 minutes drive back and forth for 2 days). I recently graduated the MS program from FCSE and there was only 1 day scholar from Rawalpindi from my batch. He used to cry all the time, he definitely made a mistake. This post and comment is for the future reference of anyone searching for MS (masters) programs in GIKI. I am not trying to diss the university, the faculty is good, but everything should be crystal clear before someone commits their time and energy for the process.\n\nEdit: Most jobs you will get expect you to be in office from 9am to 6pm on Fridays, and the classes in GIKI are throughout the day. The Day Scholar program is for a very niche set of graduates (those around Swabi) which the university should mention instead of just saying they won’t help with the accommodation."

And in next coming year's BSAI would be crowded as well so what would be the wisest option any could go for? According to my research it's uncertain or maybe there is a chance that data science would boom in next 5 years so yeah and what would be the best UNIVERSITIES? I am going for COMSATS for now idk why just kinda heard it's very good uni if anyone doing bs data science from there do let me know it would be helpful for me  GOOD UNIVERSITY GOR bs data science do let me know if anyone knows and further here are my interests.....\n\nInterests in researching like I love researching \n\nI kinda like data analysis \n\nHate maths I hate it I despise it ngl but but as long as it's logical and useful for my work for instance like using some logical calculations for projects like yk algebra type not memorising hell formulas I hate it .\n\nAnd last I have some interest in programming not that much but I can get it through if I try yk so yeah same it's logic yk \n\nand which uni i should opt for? like best universities and okaish universities and red flag universities which i should not opt for ? any help would be appreciated",

I would suggest you to not miss this opportunity and head over to GIKI for this ISYS with your friends. its 3 days of fun, discovering GIKI, fun modules, and very friendly society members who have always been nice to us and everyone else.\nJust text their insta account theyll get back to you soon. \nHope you have fun.",

It’s organized by IEEE and honestly one of the biggest events here; way larger scale, crazy participation from all over the country, and the socials are top-tier. The overall vibe is just way more lively and fun, especially if you want to get a real taste of GIKI life.",

This year’s edition has everything from RoboWars and Drone Dash to coding contests and project exhibitions.\n\nRegistrations are already open — you can find all the links and details on the official IEEE GIKI Instagram page. The fee’s pretty reasonable, especially considering the scale of the event.",
            "Biggest as in scale and diversity. it's the 18th edition of NEO this year. NEO brings in participants from all over Pakistan, not just engineers. You’ll find robotics battles, AI and coding competitions, drone racing, project showcases, plus creative stuff like art and debates.\nIt’s massive in turnout, energy, and the socials — concerts, bonfire nights, and a whole festival-like vibe. GIKI’s campus is fully alive that weekend.",
            "Ok so did some digging and few ppl here told me ieee brings kids and college students which are their target demographic. And all over pakistan means All over pakistan or just Peshawar and surrounding and Islambad/Lahore?",
            "Haha, good question! Actually, it's not just a Peshawar/Islamabad thing. NEO pulls teams from all over Pakistan every year ( cities like Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, and Quetta, plus universities from interior Sindh and Balochistan ) You'll find people from NUST, FAST, LUMS, UETs, GCU, NED, and more.",

            "That’s not true, participants from Karachi and other cities have attended in previous editions too. You might’ve had a different experience, but calling it a scam isn’t accurate or fair to the host team that puts in alot of work."

        "body": "Aoa Dosto! Today, I’m sharing a personal ordeal that many Pakistani students might relate toa frustrating battle with university administration over a fee refund. As a young aspirant navigating the chaotic world of higher education, I hope my story sheds light on a common issue and sparks some valuable advice from this supportive community.\nIt all started when I applied to NFC Faisalabad for Civil Engineering. To my surprise, I was selected—not through an official email, but via a WhatsApp message (a quirky twist, right?). Caught up in family expectations and societal pressures, my father paid a 50k installment upfront. But fate had other plans. I also applied to the University of the Punjab on a nomination basis and, elatedly, got selected there my true academic calling!\nSince I’m now enrolled and attending classes at Punjab University, I haven’t set foot in NFC Faisalabad. That 50k, however, is critical for my hostel accommodation—it could cover a full year’s expenses, and with my family facing financial constraints, every rupee counts. I assumed the refund process would be smooth, especially since most universities, following HEC guidelines, allow full refunds if no classes are attended. Boy, was I wrong.\nThe NFC management has been a maze of unresponsiveness. After multiple WhatsApp voice calls, I’m met with vague promises and excuses. They’ve hinted I might only get 8k back—or nothing at all. A week after my Punjab University nomination, I called to explain my situation and urgent need for the funds. They advised me to submit a manual application, which I did via email, complete with proof of my nomination. That was two months ago, and—crickets. No reply, no update, just silence.\nSo, here I am, puzzled and a bit desperate. Should I make the trip to NFC Faisalabad to plead my case in person? Has anyone else faced a similar refund nightmare when switching universities or under nomination? I respect the institution’s processes, but their lack of communication is testing my patience.\nIf you’ve navigated this kind of situation or have tips on approaching this respectfully yet firmly, please share your wisdom in the comments. This 50k could ease my financial burden significantly, and I’d be grateful for any support or suggestions. Let’s help each other thrive in this challenging academic journey!\nWhat would you do in my shoes? Drop your thoughts below I’m all ears!\n",

You can build projects togather, share ideas, ideate anytime, and so much more. It just lack of communication. If all of us are togather, it will be a huge thing. Dont get me wrong, but being in gdsc and mlsa is not enough for your professional growth.\n\nIf you want to be included in this whatsapp group, send me these things in dm:\n1. Resume (optional for freshers)\n2. Proof u are giki student (pic of student card, or any other proof)\n3. A simple intro about yourself (specifically coding/programming related)\n4. Ur Github profile / ss of project u r proud of\n\nThis group is for:\n1. Ppl who want to go to Hackathons\n2. Do projects together \n3. Get paid work\n4.

            "\nIf you’re already considering coming to GIKI for an All-Pak event, I’d highly recommend looking at NEO’25 (National Electronics Olympiad) instead of EVOLVE.\n\nNot saying EVOLVE is bad, but NEO has a completely different energy — it’s one of the biggest and oldest flagship events here, powered by IEEE GIKI, so you get:\n\n✅ Major technical & non-technical competitions (Robowars, Drone Dash, Ctrl+Freaks, Stand Tall — even if you’re not super technical, there’s tons to participate in)\n\n✅ Full festival vibe — theme dinner, concert, socials, closing ceremony, the whole GIKI nightlife experience 🔥\n\n✅ Accommodation & Transport from Islamabad/Rawalpindi provided, so logistics are sorted\n\n✅ Crowd from all over Pakistan — NUST, FAST, LUMS, SEECS, IST, IBA, you name it\n\nIt’s happening 21st–23rd November, so if your friends went to ENOVATE and loved it, NEO is that — but louder, crazier, and more diverse.",
            "They are a new new society to these All Paks, they only completed one all Pak which was enovate last year and the whole funding was by GMS, they did not contribute a penny, the previous president had good relations with other societies which made it successful, this year, yeh society survive krjaye bohat hai. They have very scarce knowledge about organizing an all Pak event, media, IEEE, naqsh have far better all Pak events within the amount charged by LES.",

Man Shit was ahh 😦  I cringe out thinking back ughhh would not recommend burning up your money in that instead go to all pak events that are hosted by better societies.

I met their teams working there they were soo nice especially the way they were treating guests I liked it the most .. Event was all the way soo amazing Bilal Saeed came 😭😭we really had lots of fun I meet people from NUST , UET , Air , Comsats ,Fast lhr and isb campus (p.s I was from there too but I met many new faces there ) I think you should go for Evolve’25 I feel like it will be amazing 🤩",

They will be the 90-100 people on your primary contact list. \n\nThe serious interview is the first filter to ensure the next batch is worthy of receiving (and contributing to) that trust and support that seniors in societies provide. \n\nSome societies have culture, not everyone can follow them. And having an interview under pressure can make them feel asure of your commitment. \n\nSome of you B35 gave interviews that were so trash that we just have to end them within 2-3 mins while majority gave good answers, introduced themselves so good that we thought this boy/girl has a place here. My advise, interviews can tell a lot abt you, prepare only 2 questions before going for an interview: What makes you special & Tell us about yourself (and dont say you faculty, batch, name; we already now that from your form)\n\nI had to keep this short.",

I built an AI powered career counselling chatbot which uses python and open ai. It asks the user a few questions one by one, and at the end it uses AI to suggest good career paths, along with good universities in Pakistan offering it. It's a small project and I'm tracking users, it hardly takes a minute to complete the quiz and I would really really appreciate if you all could go take that quiz. Just taking out a minute of your life can really help someone, The bot is accessible through whatsapp, it can be contacted by sending a message on the whatsapp number of the bot. You can directly access the bot by clicking on: \n\n[https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=15736374240&text=Hi+PakGenAI%21+I+want+career+guidance&type=phone\\_number&app\\_absent=0](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=15736374240&text=Hi+PakGenAI%21+I+want+career+guidance&type=phone_number&app_absent=0)\n\nIf you wanna find out more you can also see the bot's instagram, and it would actually be AMAZING if you all could follow it too.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/pakgenai/](https://www.instagram.com/pakgenai/)\n\n  \nty for reading all this\n\nALSO MANY PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS IS A SCAM OR SOMETHING BUT WHY WOULD IT BE!

You don't need to waste time in deciding what to eat, once or twice a week you could eat from tuc and satisfy your cravings. I used to think keh mess sy dinner at max 9 baje tak bhi kerunga toh late night dobara bhook lagay gi but abhi tak issue nae howa, even if that happens keep a few snacks with you in your room like dry fruits, nuts, biscuits etc. \nI would highly recommend keh whatever you decide, don't skip breakfast.

            "Bro maybe you are talking about the PhD Thesis that might be plagiarized but this was not only case with pieas many professors has done it for an instance a professor at cui who was awarded his PhD from Preston university was found that 72% of his research was plagiarized(I wouldn't like to take his name) and also I am not forcing you to go pieas but you urself are clearly confused upon what u need to do and at the end of the day it all just depends on you like if you study at giki,nust,lums or anywhere MIT is not calling you or handing an ms in geophysics degree in ur hands so focus more on urself do some research and go wherever you want to go.Best if luck!",

I got socialize though I am an introvert person.\n\nHowever, the downside came after the introduction. I discovered that many people come to GIKI because they were rejected by the university I chose to decline, which made me feel as though I had diminished my own worth. I can't blame my family for this; it was my decision to make..\n\nIn conclusion, while I do experience regret, I also find happiness in my current position, and I wish to that I could adjust here.

It's far worse compared to GIKI.\n\nI'm being biased or having sentimental feelings for GIKI, but whatever the case may be GIKI is one of if not the best place where you can get a unique once in a lifetime University experience.\n\nWhile any University may be a once in a lifetime, but they sure as hell ain't unique or enjoyable. The social life at NUST is nowhere near as GIKI.\n\nYou should try hanging around in social circles an societies at GIKI. If even then your an Introvert or don't like hanging out with peers than it's just a personal preference. But if you were at NUST or any other university... Oh boy you would feel like an unfortunate outcast...",

It may seem insignificant since it's 1/48th of ur day but it adds up since \nA) you do it with a clear mind i.e no pressure of quiz or exam\nB) you develop concepts of a subject and gain open mindedness when you start solving practice questions so u can expect which otherwise is unexpected for others during the exam\nC) somedays you spend those 30 mins doing assignments which eliminates dependency on others",

I know studying daily might be difficult just study on weekends, do assignments yourself study for quiz and mids and finals you will ace it. Don’t worry about background CS is easy anyone can learn just need practice like Math.  Don’t be a theeta…. enjoy giki life and just be good in time management.",
            "Study for quizzes, do your assignments yourself w understanding, utilize weekends to the maximum, give input in socities but dont let it drive your life. During mids and finals focus solely on studies. Dont miss classes, study attentively during em. And lastly, prioritize what you really want to do",

I also don't know anything about the entry test..how much time would I need to prepare for it to get a good grade and get in? \n\nMy O levels is 2A*'s 3A's and 4B's.\nMy SAT was 1260, so I'll be giving it again in March to improve it. \nMy A levels is 2C's 1D. I took Physics, Math and CS(D in CS). I am giving retakes for Math and CS in Oct/Nov 2025 to hopefully improve them. \n\nIs there a chance for me to get in? My extracurricular aren't that special, I did a few school events in o levels but never won anything there, I did a little bit of social work and some stuff related to art where I got 2nd place in this competition..it really isn't that special in my opinion cuz everyone I know that gets into schools like LUMS, GIKI or IBA have a good CV with a lot of events and organisation's they were a part of or led. \n\nI really need advice..also for a backup degree..incase I don't get in for CS..which would be good to go for, considering I also enjoy designing and art a lot honestly..\n",

            "Ok so the most important thing for your admission is the entry test. The entry test is comprised of the FSC syllabus. The majority section is Math IIRC. So if you want to secure admission focus on that. The questions are not that hard, just focus on covering the enter syllabus. There is a teacher on YouTube who goes by the name of Engineer Bilal who prepares student for entry test, I recommend him as his videos helped me also get accepted into NUST CS program in NET 4. Other than that your Matric equaliavalent marks matter too but not to the extent of the entry test, which is probably around 75 percent. \n\nYou can also find Google drives full of KIPS notes etc. of the FSC syllabus for entry tests. There are also NUST past paper question books that you can do for more prep.\n\nAs far as other options go if you don't get into CS or AI, you can try engineering degrees such as CE, EE or ME as those involve design work to an extent.",

Yesterday my father told me he’s having serious financial issues in his business and he’s worried it’ll be tough to pay the fees for the coming semesters.\n\nNow I’m really stressed. I’ve heard that the top 2–3 students in the class get a scholarship, is that actually true? If I work really hard and manage to top the class, will it help me financially?

I feel like I'm at least 3 or 4 years behind. I'm also trying to apply abroad, but I don't know; I don't want to waste time in case that falls through. I was previously studying at FC in biotechnology; however, that completely sucked. The people there are amazing, but the faculty and administration—everything—sucks. No campus life. I'm on probation now, and I'm studying for the entry test. I have 7-8 months which is more than enough time but i still feel sad/embarrassed that a cousin that is younger than me by atleast 4 or 5 years would be my senior. Its crazy.  I'm aiming for management sciences at GIKI but just got to know they open their admission in late april or May. Aiming to study for the entry test while my apps are in process, im unsure what to do  ",

The filters are available from Daraz and I ordered a bunch for myself for the 4 years. You'll need 3-4 filters for 1 year. It made the water taste better and cleaned up those white specs in it.

I used 3 filters per year. Total cost was 14600 for the 4 years and I could refill it from the cooler anytime. \nAlso paani akelay toh aap use nahin kartay.

This came as a shock to me, as I had never been informed of this before.\n\nMr. Usman then asked me to email Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed again with him in CC.

The faculty was great at GIKI too especially in my department.\n\nAlso post graduation, most nustians are for sure nerdier and less socially aware/active than gikians. GIKI did make me much better at socializing than NUST.\n\nParhai is great at GIKI and NUST,  but I think what really matters are the connections you make and how you grow as a person. And a lot of it is on you rather than the place you go to.\n\nGoodluck with the decision!",

Nothing people here will change your mind, so go with what you wanna pick. \n\nLuckily for you, both are top universities, there is no wrong option. Id say picking fast over nust makes sense for cs if you know ur goals well. Some people do that. \n\nGiki probably has a better hostile and social life if thats what u prioritise. Go for it. You will still have equal opportunity as much as you would on nust. \n\nBut ask yourself this. In 1-2 years time, would u regret giving up your nust admission? Is it something you'll think about. \nDoesn't matter which ones better. What you do depends on you anyways. BUT trust me having regrets is the worst mindset u can fall into. So if ur unsure think carefully but if not, just shoot.\n\nAgain, both are within top 3 in pakistan tbh. Opportunities will be equal. Nust has slightly better global recognition for sure if you care about masters abroad a ton.",

            "Okay, great. Can’t say anything now. Nust is great. I have been to nust h12 two times while in Giki as my cousin studied there and I could have a good comparison of pros and cons of both but you should always defend your university so I consider Giki the best in the world and you must consider nust.",

You can work as a MTO at Unilever, or a field job at a power plant, or work in a robotics startup, or if you like you can do MS in CS or AI. Doing EE also gives you a lot of options. Especially GIKI has a very good reputation among a lot of companies, so most of us eventually get hired.",
            "Welcome bro.",
            "It varies. Field work initially has low pay like 40k or 50k if you work as a apprentice, but it increase eventually. At a big company like nestle, a lot more than 1lakh. I think most of us eventually get jobs above 70k.",
            "Funny thing is that EE is better abroad nowadays",
            "True. A lot of degrees in pakistan have no scope. Yet as soon as you go abroad, you can easily get a job. Especially in pakistan, getting a entry level job can be tough. Yet once you break the barrier, it eventually gets easier for you"

My merit position isnt great as i didnt really care about the exam and left after attempting half the exam and got a 3000s MP.

            "What should you bring to GIKI\n\nWhat to Bring to GIKI\n\n\r\nEssentials List\n\n\r\nThis list is meant for things that are non-negotiable\n\n\r\n1.\tBedsheets\n\n\r\nBring at least 2 bedsheets. GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou’ll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It’ll help in both sun and rain. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n9.\tCleaning Cloth\n\n\r\nUseful when you spill tea, coffee or anything else on your desk.\n\n\r\n10.\tLaptop\n\n\r\nGo for at least an 8th gen i5 or i7 with 8GB RAM. An SSD makes a big difference if you can afford one. This is the minimum. You can go higher if you want.\n\n\r\n11.\tPhone Charger\n\n\r\nObvious but easy to forget. Don’t leave it behind.\n\n\r\n12.\tRucksack or Backpack\n\n\r\nPerfect for carrying snacks from TUC to your room without making it obvious. Also works for books if you decide to study.\n\n\r\n13.\tLaundry Basket or Bucket\n\n\r\nSomething to throw dirty clothes in. I used a bucket and washed socks in it too. Don’t use your chair for laundry or you’ll have nowhere to sit. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n14.\tNail cutter\n\n\r\nNakhun kaatne ke liye yes\n\n\r\n15.\tStapler\n\n\r\nVery important.

        "body": "I’ve been hearing mixed opinions about GIKI lately, especially that the teachers and faculty aren’t as good as before, and that the sports, gym, and other facilities aren’t really up to the mark either. Many people also say that it has become very overcrowded now and is mostly a good university for book lovers or people who just want to study, but not for those who want a balanced social life. Since living in a hostel there for four years comes with very high fees, I’m wondering if it’s really worth it. On the other hand, I also got admission into NUST, but only in Liberal Arts and Humanities, and I’m not sure how much scope that degree really has. So I’m confused whether it’s better to go for NUST in this field or to consider GIKI, since I’ve also heard from some people that GIKI’s overall standard has gone down quite a bit. I don’t know if this is just a rumor or the reality.\n\nPlease let me know anyone any senior or an expert\n",

            "Faulty isn’t the best bur its only second to Lums, still significantly better than other unis , facilities are mid,book worms fact is true but thats only half the people not 100%, but don’t go for scope or any other bs , if the liberal arts and humanities thing or Nust is in your mind then go for it.",
            "The fundamental question is not about giki vs. nust but what do you wanna study in undergrad? Liberal Arts and Humanities are a fine major if you are into it. Don’t select a major because it has supposedly “high demand” or the “campus looks pretty and looks like a picnic”. Do what you want to do. If you decide based on jobs or some other criteria - you will burn out and lose yourself (psychologically: depression, anxiety, low self esteem) in the end. On the other hand, studying what you like will energize you and it won’t feel like a chore.",

I went for a little more than one month to Saudi Arabia and I got 3.4 cgpa in that semester."

        "body": "Hi everyone, so basically I unexpectedly got into giki and I’m going to have to move there in about a week and it’s all very fast paced and unexpected. I just wanted to ask what the social life is like and whether it’s possible to find likeminded people there. Also, is it more of a self study situation, or can you depend on your professors for material? I’m studying chemical engineering for context. If anyone could lemme know it would be really appreciated I’m a bit nervous about this whole change.",

Also, for the clothes for now, take summer clothes and some clothes that you can wear in the mixed weather AND some hoodies and jackets too because it sometimes gets cold there like that. \nTake ur essentials, take a pillow or a cushion too (even tho they give you a pillow). You can get your groceries from there. You can get a mirror from there as well or bring it from home whatever you think is suitable for you.\nYou can take an iron and a kettle with you (thet give you a kettle too so it's not necessary). Heaters aren't allowed, they might allow or give a heater if it gets really cold. \nThat's all i can help you with rn",

            "And is it confirm that all 100 are filled",
            "No, it depends on how many people actually decide to pay the fees. Let’s say the starting merit for the first merit list was 1 and the closing merit was 800 — if more than 100 people out of those 800 decide to take admission, then there won’t be a second merit list, because the maximum they can take is around 100–150 students in one go. But if fewer people decide to avail the admission offer, then another merit list is made from the waiting list. The better your merit position, the better your chance of getting the offer.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that there’s a very slim chance of a third merit list, because it’s confirmed that around 80–85 seats were already taken from the first list, and after the second merit list it seems like all seats are occupied. Still, I’d advise you to wait until the 15th — after that, there’s literally no hope."

I’d really value input from someone who has been through both—worked in Pakistan and then moved to Germany.\n\nWould gaining a 2-3 years of relevant experience in Pakistan lets say from MNCs add meaningful value to my profile in Germany, or is it better to apply straight away while I have academic momentum?\n\nLong term plan is to shift back after getting a passport and to start a business. \n\nThe goal is to land a good job in the automotive/FMCG sector in germany.

Is there any way I could get a single occupancy room or a room with no roommate for some time. Maybe just a couple of weeks. My merit position is 492. \n\nWill greatly appreciate any help.

I’m pretty confident about that now. \n\nHonestly, I'm okay with the idea of studying medicine, but I worry that I won't be able to handle the stress. It sounds like it would be super overwhelming. \n\nOn the flip side, I’ve always been really into money and business, and MGS seems like the best fit for that. Choosing MGS would give me way more freedom and opens up so many opportunities.\n\nI definitely feel more excited thinking about MGS, but I don’t want to let my parents down. They’ve done so much for me and are honestly the best parents I could ask for. It feels wrong to just turn my back on their wishes. \n\nI really need some help figuring this out; I can’t make such a huge decision on my own right now.",

            "If LUMS is a big financial burden for you, I’d strongly suggest going for GIKI. I did my BS in AI from GIKI and I graduated last year and honestly, it was one of the best decisions of my life. I while studying in Giki got fully funded Master’s by research offers abroad as well as jobs overseas with relocation support, so trust me, the opportunities are there. Giki Alumni network is very strong and the name is very good even out of Pakistan.\n\nGIKI hostel life is also way better in my opinion. I’ve seen the hostels, mess, and overall environment of both GIKI and LUMS, and I preferred GIKI by far. LUMS has a lot of day scholars, while GIKI is entirely on-campus, so you get that full university experience.\n\nAlmost 90% graduates of Giki’s FCSE got job after one month of graduation while others opted for master’s abroad, so the job placement is very high.\n\nIf you’re from Lahore and plan to live at home, then LUMS could make sense. But in my case, I had to stay in a hostel, and I chose GIKI – never regretted it for a moment.\n\nIf you have any other concerns you may reply, I would love to guide.",

Academics are great, exposure is great too. \n\nGIKI is a tougher ball game. But what it teaches you is how to handle tough experiences. The societies are great, the bond you share is life long even with those who graduated before your time when you enter the real world. \n\nWhether you're looking to stay here or go abroad, how it plays depends totally on your own approach to your uni years. People in my circle from both are doing similarly both professionally and in their masters. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything specific that you have in mind",

Now I have two options: either I join FAST, study Electrical Engineering for a year, and then apply for an internal transfer to CS or I join a private university for CS this year and then try to transfer to universities like GIKI, LUMS etc., next year if make it till there My long-term goal is to do my Master’s abroad, and I’ve heard that FAST has a strict GPA policy, fewer extracurricular opportunities, and a heavy workload, which might make it harder to build a strong profile for masters abroad ..On the other hand, the private university might offer more flexibility but doesn’t have the same reputation. I’m really stuck between these two paths and would appreciate any advice on what seems like the smarter move ..\n(Plus  I Barely had 3 months to study for entrance exam due to some reason )",

Me and my friend started to look out for unis to find which one is best for cs. Wrote every uni in lahore and at the end left with fast and itu. Fast me admission hoa ni itu ka dia ni. Dimagh me yhi tha ke lahore se to bahir nhi jana or hostel life bhi ni reh layein ge. In short, lack of exposure and counseling. Phr kuch research ke baad options samne aye ke umt ya ucp. Umt me hogya or ucp me abhi result ana h. Baat yh ha keh ik GIKi is a better uni then ucp and umt wagera but i didnt submitted my application in giki or ab agr mjhe GIK janey ke liye gap lena pre ga. To sawaal yhi ha ke mne krna h CS ya DS to kya me gap lun ya nhi or gap kitna lamba hoskta h?\nJazakAllahu khyar for reading!\n\nEdit: everyone who is advising for giki plz tell me entry test ki tyyari kahan se krni h cz fast ka experiance hochuka h mera preparation ke beghair to ni honewala!",

        "body": "What are your thoughts on this ChatGPT Comparison?\n\nEntrance exams for GIKI, NUST, and FAST are all challenging, but each assesses different aspects of a student's abilities. Here's a breakdown:\n\nGIKI Admission Test\nFocus: Emphasizes conceptual understanding, problem-solving, and speed. Less about memorization, more about applying logic in Maths and Physics.\nStrength: Ideal for identifying students who excel at handling unfamiliar problems and thinking analytically — similar to international standards like SAT Subject Tests or parts of the JEE.\nCalibre Measured: Deep analytical skills, raw intelligence, and time management under pressure.\n\nNUST NET\nFocus: Covers a wide range — Maths, Physics, English, and Chemistry/CS (depending on the program). Includes both recall-based and reasoning questions.\nStrength: Good for evaluating a student's breadth of knowledge and ability to work quickly on familiar material. High volume of questions makes speed and accuracy essential.\nCalibre Measured: Retention, speed, and general academic preparation. Slightly less depth per question compared to GIKI.\n\nFAST Admission Test\nFocus: MCQ-based and typically shorter. Concentrates on fundamental concepts, often more straightforward than GIKI or NUST.\nStrength: Efficient at assessing whether students have a clear grasp of basics and can perform under time pressure.\nCalibre Measured: Solid foundation, quick thinking, and familiarity with the curriculum.\n\nWhich Test Best Measures Calibre?\nGIKI: Generally considered the toughest. Best for identifying students with strong analytical and conceptual abilities.\n\nNUST: Effective for testing overall academic preparation and stamina, with a mix of recall and reasoning.\n\nFAST: Reliable for checking basic understanding and quick thinking, though often seen as slightly easier than the other two.\n\nSummary\nRaw analytical thinking: GIKI > NUST ≈ FAST\nBreadth and speed: NUST > FAST > GIKI\nBasics and foundation: FAST ≈ NUST > GIKI",

            "What should you bring to GIKI\n\nWhat to Bring to GIKI\n\n\r\nEssentials List\n\n\r\nThis list is meant for things that are non-negotiable\n\n\r\n1.\tBedsheets\n\n\r\nBring at least 2 bedsheets. GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou’ll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It’ll help in both sun and rain. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n9.\tCleaning Cloth\n\n\r\nUseful when you spill tea, coffee or anything else on your desk.\n\n\r\n10.\tLaptop\n\n\r\nGo for at least an 8th gen i5 or i7 with 8GB RAM. An SSD makes a big difference if you can afford one. This is the minimum. You can go higher if you want.\n\n\r\n11.\tPhone Charger\n\n\r\nObvious but easy to forget. Don’t leave it behind.\n\n\r\n12.\tRucksack or Backpack\n\n\r\nPerfect for carrying snacks from TUC to your room without making it obvious. Also works for books if you decide to study.\n\n\r\n13.\tLaundry Basket or Bucket\n\n\r\nSomething to throw dirty clothes in. I used a bucket and washed socks in it too. Don’t use your chair for laundry or you’ll have nowhere to sit. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n14.\tNail cutter\n\n\r\nNakhun kaatne ke liye yes\n\n\r\n15.\tStapler\n\n\r\nVery important. Bring a stapler, get extra pins, and keep them stocked.\n\n\r\n16.\tHangers\n\n\r\nHelps when you wake up at 7:50 for a class at 8:00. Just grab the hanged clothes, pitstop at the bathroom and rush to class.\n\n\r\n17.\tTissues\n\n\r\nUseful for all kinds of situations. You can always steal some from the mess or TUC, but better to keep your own incase you need them at night or hours when they are closed.\n\n\r\n18.\tSnacks\n\n\r\nMidnight cravings hit hard. Especially when you are studying. I personally prefer biscuits. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n19.\tPrayer Mat\n\n\r\nNamaz parhna, acha grade aye ga.\n\n\r\n20.\tPlates, Cup, Glass, Utensils, Bowl\n\n\r\nYou won’t need these in the mess, but you will in your room when you're eating something on your own. \n\n\r\n21.\tDeodorant, Body Spray or Perfume\n\n\r\nSmelling nice makes a good impression. Don't skip this.\n\n\r\n22.\tSewing Kit\n\n\r\nIf your shirt tears, you’ll have to fix it yourself. A small kit will help. Ab barey honey ka time aa geya he.\n\n\r\n23.\tDetergent (Small Pack)\n\r\nIn case something spills on your clothes, you can soak them quickly and avoid stains. Laundry service is available, but it is scheduled. Your clothes will get permanent stains until he comes. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n24.\tDishwashing Items\n\n\r\nYou’ll need to wash your own plates and cups. Bring a sponge and dish soap. Lemon max mera hero. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n25.\tCNIC and Registration Info\n\n\r\nYou’ll need these during check-in and formalities. Keep them safe.\n\n\r\n26.\tScissors\n\n\r\nYou’ll be surprised how often these come in handy. I even used them to fix my moustache the morning of my final presentation. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n27.\tKnife\n\n\r\nCan cut fruits, salads, ropes, people (don’t cut people 0/10 move highly unrecommended, 0 tolerance policy).\n\n\r\n28.\tSlippers\n\n\r\nSo you can slip in washroom (bad joke I know). Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n29.\tClothes\n\n\r\nThere’s no Dress code at GIKI but wear proper clothes. You’re not Tarzan. Can be bought from inside GIKI but I recommend that you bring your good clothes.\n\n\r\n30.\tMirror\n\n\r\nA small personal mirror helps you check your face before heading out.\n\n\r\n31.\tCalculator\n\n\r\nYou’re doing engineering. You know why this is important. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n32.\tElectric Kettle\n\n\r\nThis will save your life. Makes noodles, tea, coffee, boiled eggs and milk. Try to get one with a wide mouth. Narrow ones can be a pain. I know people who even tried to cook food in their kettle. I don’t know if they succeeded. But it is a true partner.\n\n\r\n33.\tElectric Iron\n\n\r\nDoes your clothes have wrinkles before an important meeting? This guy will help. Also used to heat food by students. You will learn the secret ways young pupil.\n\n\r\n34.\tOnline banking\n\n\r\nGet yourself an online bank account. Giki mein boht ziada use hota hai\n\n\r\n35.\tUFONE SIM\n\n\r\nIf possible, get yourself Ufone sim. Ufone works the best in GIK, ZONG ki service aksar down hoti hai. \n\n\r\n36.\tMedicines\n\n\r\nYou can get medicines from medical center here laikin basic medicines like Panadol, brufen,  arinac, etc. waise hi honi chahiye (laikin buntiyon ki tarah nahi khani). Also if you take any instructed medicine, wo lazmi rakh lena coz there’s a chance ke wo giki se na millein.\r\n\n\n\nCopied !",

In almost every situation a student isn’t made to do stuff that he wouldn’t have and the tolerance level is also kept under consideration when a new student is ragged. Koi student specially targeted Nahi hota but some are aswell specially those who are a bit too “shokhay” if u know what I mean. Baqi yes ragging is a bit common yahan.

There is a hefty fees so there should be an acceptance gift and many things like that tbh Giki degree is very costly and if you have that cost in mind all the time you will be depressed. \n\nIf you have very high expectations, you would regret, tbh when I was at your stage in 2020 I had very low expectations from Giki as I wanted to study abroad but couldn’t go due to corona but Alhamdulillah due to my lower expectations, I loved the Giki hostel life. I expected very poor hostels thats why I liked the hostels. I expected very bad mess food, though it is bland but I liked it and kept eating only from mess for two years as I had low expectations. Read great expectations book.\n\n\nI had graduated in 2024 and tbh studying at Giki was the best decision ever. No regrets. I was part of first batch of AI. Got three offer letters and scholarship during final exams of final semester.",
            "So we cant say its a “below-average” institution haina? (Saw a comment defaming giki lol) \n\nAtleast guzar jaata time and market/abroad mai bhi value hai. \n\nCould you guide me on how you landed offers/scholarships? Did you have to do anything extra than the degree itself (like online courses) \n\nThankyou.",
            "Giki is the best university in Pakistan. There are many defamers out there. Don’t worry. I graduated in 2024 in AI major. Major maters a lot if you go Giki for materials and don’t get a job as no material industry in Pakistan so that’s a Pakistan economy fault not Giki fault.\n\nEven abroad values giki degree a lot. I am in Saudi Arabia right now and here an IT manager didn’t ask any technical interview after knowing that I am a Giki graduate. \n\nI didn’t do any online courses or training, not a single one from coursera tbh. I have all the theoretical knowledge of AI given by Giki though my gpa was 2.7/4. Work experience polished it. I had work experience as I started doing freelancing in my third year in Giki and a full time remote job during my final year in Giki.",
            "OMG THIS IS SUCH A RELIEF! Actually i got into Software Engineering and missed AI by 20 merit positions. Ive enrolled in SWE and intend to do multiple renowned AI courses so that I am theoretically and skillfully informed of that as well.",

            "What should you bring to GIKI\n\nWhat to Bring to GIKI\n\n\r\nEssentials List\n\n\r\nThis list is meant for things that are non-negotiable\n\n\r\n1.\tBedsheets\n\n\r\nBring at least 2 bedsheets. GIKI gives you a mattress and a mattress cover, but the bedsheets are on you.\n\n\r\n2.\tPillow Cover\n\n\r\nYou’ll get a pillow from GIKI, but not the cover. Bring one or two of your own.\n\n\r\n3.\tBlanket/Chadar\n\n\r\nYou will have 1 week break after mids to get stuff for Winters. No need to bring at the start. You will also need Electric Blower in winter, but November me le ana when you get mid break.\n\n\r\n4.\tToiletries\n\n\r\nThe basics like soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste. Stay clean and fresh. Can be bought from inside GIK.\n\n\r\n5.\tTowels\n\n\r\nOne hand towel and one bath towel. Using one towel for everything isn't a flex. Just bring both.\n\n\r\n6.\tWater Bottle\n\n\r\nA vacuum flask bottle is a good idea. Saves you from running to the water dispenser every time you're thirsty. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n7.\tBug Spray\n\n\r\nYou will need this. Mortein or Kingtox, your choice. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n8.\tUmbrella\n\n\r\nGet a white or silver-colored one. It’ll help in both sun and rain. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n9.\tCleaning Cloth\n\n\r\nUseful when you spill tea, coffee or anything else on your desk.\n\n\r\n10.\tLaptop\n\n\r\nGo for at least an 8th gen i5 or i7 with 8GB RAM. An SSD makes a big difference if you can afford one. This is the minimum. You can go higher if you want.\n\n\r\n11.\tPhone Charger\n\n\r\nObvious but easy to forget. Don’t leave it behind.\n\n\r\n12.\tRucksack or Backpack\n\n\r\nPerfect for carrying snacks from TUC to your room without making it obvious. Also works for books if you decide to study.\n\n\r\n13.\tLaundry Basket or Bucket\n\n\r\nSomething to throw dirty clothes in. I used a bucket and washed socks in it too. Don’t use your chair for laundry or you’ll have nowhere to sit. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n14.\tNail cutter\n\n\r\nNakhun kaatne ke liye yes\n\n\r\n15.\tStapler\n\n\r\nVery important. Bring a stapler, get extra pins, and keep them stocked.\n\n\r\n16.\tHangers\n\n\r\nHelps when you wake up at 7:50 for a class at 8:00. Just grab the hanged clothes, pitstop at the bathroom and rush to class.\n\n\r\n17.\tTissues\n\n\r\nUseful for all kinds of situations. You can always steal some from the mess or TUC, but better to keep your own incase you need them at night or hours when they are closed.\n\n\r\n18.\tSnacks\n\n\r\nMidnight cravings hit hard. Especially when you are studying. I personally prefer biscuits. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n19.\tPrayer Mat\n\n\r\nNamaz parhna, acha grade aye ga.\n\n\r\n20.\tPlates, Cup, Glass, Utensils, Bowl\n\n\r\nYou won’t need these in the mess, but you will in your room when you're eating something on your own. \n\n\r\n21.\tDeodorant, Body Spray or Perfume\n\n\r\nSmelling nice makes a good impression. Don't skip this.\n\n\r\n22.\tSewing Kit\n\n\r\nIf your shirt tears, you’ll have to fix it yourself. A small kit will help. Ab barey honey ka time aa geya he.\n\n\r\n23.\tDetergent (Small Pack)\n\r\nIn case something spills on your clothes, you can soak them quickly and avoid stains. Laundry service is available, but it is scheduled. Your clothes will get permanent stains until he comes. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n24.\tDishwashing Items\n\n\r\nYou’ll need to wash your own plates and cups. Bring a sponge and dish soap. Lemon max mera hero. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n25.\tCNIC and Registration Info\n\n\r\nYou’ll need these during check-in and formalities. Keep them safe.\n\n\r\n26.\tScissors\n\n\r\nYou’ll be surprised how often these come in handy. I even used them to fix my moustache the morning of my final presentation. Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n27.\tKnife\n\n\r\nCan cut fruits, salads, ropes, people (don’t cut people 0/10 move highly unrecommended, 0 tolerance policy).\n\n\r\n28.\tSlippers\n\n\r\nSo you can slip in washroom (bad joke I know). Can be bought from inside GIKI.\n\n\r\n29.\tClothes\n\n\r\nThere’s no Dress code at GIKI but wear proper clothes. You’re not Tarzan. Can be bought from inside GIKI but I recommend that you bring your good clothes.\n\n\r\n30.\tMirror\n\n\r\nA small personal mirror helps you check your face before heading out.\n\n\r\n31.\tCalculator\n\n\r\nYou’re doing engineering.

            "Giki hostel life is the best.\n\nDon’t worey about laundry. Laundry is very cheap thete, it costed me 500 rupees a month as while semester breaks I took the clothes home for laundry, that was 1 years ago. And they also ironed it for me. Though I had kept iron in my room but mostly I used it very less. Legally having iron in room is not allowed but tbh there are no rules in Giki Alhamdulillah.\n\nRest assured don’t worry!\n\nWill paste my comment in another post too here below…\n\nGiki is the best university in Pakistan. I graduated in 2024 and tbh studying at Giki was one of the best decisions of my life and I never regret it. During my final exams I was able to get scholarships and three job offer letters. The hostel life is very good and ragging is part of hostel life tbh. Ragging exists in every university of Pakistan but don’t worry it’s also an integral part of Giki culture and I like it tbh. In my case I got ragging which was when I went to a senior room the first day I entered Giki so be like me don’t be afraid of ragging, the more you fear the more you will get tensed. Most likely, you will not suffer extreme ragging but if you suffer that, do not hesitate to complain to warden and dean of student affairs.",

            "No guarantee. After 4 years you will be able to return the funds in 5 years the chance is 1% only tbh. Most probably you will land a job of 60k on an average after graduation and even counting the increments it would be very hard. This depends on your naseeb and your skill set. But tbh you are from lower middle class don’t take that risk and go to any other university. I was from an upper middle class and my father could easily pay the tuition fees of Giki. Tbh I studied from Giki from 2020 to 2024 and got a 2.7/4 in Giki. 1.48 in one semester, right now I can return the funds in 6 months but I am the only one in 50 students who can do that, I guess in 500 there will be 10 of us only so for you to be like us only 2% chance. Though I give giki a big credit. I only have giki degree, no other courses, no other certifications. I only have the AI knowledge that Giki gave. My work experience though polished it more. The main thing was my naseeb tbh, we can’t more than our naseeb.",

            "I think GIKI is better than NUST, especially when it comes to the overall student experience and the environment. GIKI’s campus life is unmatched it’s fully residential, so you really get that proper university vibe, everyone lives on campus, you make close friends, and you’re part of amazing societies and events. Plus, GIKI’s alumni network is super strong and supportive....... People here genuinely help each other out. The brand name is really respected too (in engineering and management alike) and you get more chances to stand out and build strong connections. So yeah, the experience and exposure are totally worth it.",
            "Acha I’m gonna give you an honest review , Giki is anything but an MGS university , i personally wouldn’t reccomend to GIki for MGS because mahool is so engineering like and everyone except the few mgs students are studying sciences and engineering , while nust mein social sciences ki ache khaasi fields hai,so that would definitely lead to more exposure.Giki’s MGS is really good the course structure is really good and the faculty is very good as well, Giki really focused on it’s faculty and course outline.The dean is a super competent man who gained his education from one of the best UK unis and etc.Nust mein its quite literally the opposite,the academics are bad the faculty is an utter mess . But baat wohi aa jati hai Giki is an Engineering and Technology uni while Nust has a lot of social sciences, business and humanities programs. plus let’s not forget the high academic rigor in Giki. The on campus life is amazing in Giki and definitely better than Nust, but overall Nust life is a massive W because of location and the fact that you get time to relax, go to islamabad and stuff. So nust for the win in this case , unless there is something specific about Giki that you life , after all Giki is a very different uni and if you do enough research you’ll get hooked onto one or many of it’s things.",

Kuch maths ke courses bhe Kam kardeye the aur saray ache faculty CS and AI ko assign kardeye. We were assigned new lecturer (most of which have lil academic or industrial xp) so academically less than stellar xp. After 2021, they reverted back to core-curriculum for all eng courses (meaning 1st year students will share common courses with other departments) which I think is kinda better. \n\nThey have hired some pretty big names from NUST Chip Design Center (NCDC) and their own Chip-DV initiative so emphasis is now also being put on hardware side of CE. Hopefully, things will be better for you guys. Labs and overall infrastructure mei GIKI is better than EME. You could also argue GIKI is a bigger name than EME in industry. Most of the ppl that I have met in chip design companies are mostly from PIEAS, NUST SEECS, UETs, and GIKI. That being said, EME peeps (those I have met) have mostly shared positive experiences in CEME."

            "If you're from lahore then go to lse.\n\nFast shouldn't even be a consideration.",
            "Fast shouldn't even be an option for BBA\nLse should always be your top priority for business oriented programs unless u have lums or iba in consideration. That being said, Giki is overall a better institute than Lse and will give u the bettr uni experience.",
            "Giki mgs if you are into moving out and experience a hostel life otherwise lse is good too   \nThe thing is that giki as an institute has a very good name in the job market, idk about Lse but the downside is  giki is still considered as an engineering uni and Lse is a business institute so you will find better learning there.",
            "None, only IBA and LUMs for management degrees. The rest shouldn't be an option",

            "is fast that bad",
            "Yeah I agree, I went to GIKI and I think you'll benefit from the name and holistic uni experience. Almost all my MGS friends are working at top MNCs like schlum, nestle, unilever, tetra, Reckit.\n\nI don't know if LSE has the same level of prestige with MNCs, but I am pretty sure you get a chance to get into them as opposed to FAST, which doesn't have that at all. Apart from that, LSE costs less than GIKI, too. But LSE doesn't have the same uni experience because they don't have hostels inside uni, and i heard that it closes in the evening. \n\nSo in the end it's about uni experience, and the cost benefit analysis.",
            "Not all. Fast is arguably the best institute for CS and SE in Pakistan and has a very strong employment rate after graduation, on par with Lums, giki and nust etc\n\nIt's uni life however is very depressing. Always had fastians around myself in Islamabad and safe to say they were always lifeless."

            "Mess is 560/day lunch+dinner counted together. (even if you eat one, both will be counted so eat both), makes 16.5k/month, add up some misc changer and it is 17.5k per month. \n\nBreakfast is 190/day. That makes it 23.5k per month.\n\n\n\nCafe is cheaper. You can buy what you want to eat. Everything is subsidized in Cafe. Limited options though. 5 dish menu, choose one. They have some bakery options as well but bakery options are 0/10. Otherwise it is good. \n\n\nTuc is best option. You can eat for as low as 70/meal to 2000/meal depending on how good your quiz went. Tuc has many options like desi, fast food, Chinese, Italian (not authentic Italian. Hate authentic Italian. I don't speak mario 🙏🏻) so tuc is a good option. It is like a good street.",

Is that true?\n\nAlso, what happens after the transfer? How are the foundation year courses managed, and how hard is it to get into those CS fields?\n\nWould appreciate any guidance.
