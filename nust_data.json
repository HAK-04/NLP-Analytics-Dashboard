        "body": "For the past two days I've been studying in the main library. Whenever it's time for namaz, nobody comes up to be the imam. Everybody keeps forcing the others on their side \"ap namaz parhayen, nahi nahi ap parhayen\" to each other so I just go ahead and become the imam. Nothing special about it. \n\nToday at Asr time i became the imam again. After concluding the prayer, I was about to go when this maulvi sahab with a cap and a beard stopped me and initiated this conversation in a loud, arrogant voice. Here's how the conversation went:\n\nHim: Ap hafiz hain? \n\nMe: Nahi.\n\nHim: Tou jo hafiz hain unko aanay diya karen aap kyun aagay aajatay hain? \n\nMe: Koi aur aata hi nahi, sab ek dusre ko boltay rehty hain tou me aajata hun. \n\nHim: Ap dekhen na aapne topi pehni hai, na apki darhi lambi hai, kapre bhi aapne trouser shirt pehnay hain. Humen sharam aajati hai aapke peechay namaz parhty huye. \n\nMe: Mujhe tou nahi pta kon hafiz hai, jisne namaz parhaani hoti hai usko bolen pehle se aagay aa kar bethay imam ki jagah pe.\n\nHim: Ap sabar kiya karen. Ap hafiz bhi nahi hain ap kyun jaldi karte hain imam ban'ne me? \n\nMe: Mera shauq hai. \n\nHim: Allah apka shauq and apki namaz qubool karay, lekin ap na aagay aaya karen. Please bura na maaniyega. Humen namaz karwaane diya karen.\n\nAnd now I'm convinced these maulvis are just show-baaz, dikhaaway ke imams. If I was wearing one of my thobes, nobody would've questioned me cause people assume I'm an Arab, or have spent time there. He didn't even have enough etiquettes to pull me to a side to have this conversation, he intentionally did it like that so everyone around would hear it and not question his authority to be the imam from next time.\n\nGonna visit the DD's office tomorrow to make a complaint, we'll see how it goes. Don't wanna let this slide easily, it discourages youth from taking initiative, breaks their confidence, and actually disheartens them to participate in religious affairs.\n\nUPDATE: Went to Student Affairs today and lodged a formal complaint. \n\nUPDATE 2: Complaint forwarded to Chief Librarian for necessary action.

            "this is so impolite. God bless you for your intentions though and your way of handling things.",
            "The way he said it is indeed deserving of criticism. When it comes to being the Imam, definitely it is required that it be someone \"baa shara\", as in someone following the sharee'ah: having a beard as per sunnah (not even a trimmed styled one, a proper length beard), one who has good qira'at, tajweed (pronunciation), and is dressed per shareeah as well, not having form fitting clothes which are in general questionable as well. So he is not wrong in that sense. If there are other people who fit the description of someone who can be an Imam then it is preferrable to have them lead the prayer. If not available at all (as in even after waiting a certain period), then perhaps you could lead the prayer.\n\nHere is a simplified basic list of requirments for an Imam:\n\n* Must be **sane (of sound mind)**\n* Must be **adult (reached puberty)**\n* Must have **correct knowledge of how to pray**\n* Must be able to **recite Qur’an properly (especially Surah al-Fātiḥah)**\n* Must be of **good moral character** and **not known for open sin (open sin means fisq, and the one who commits sin openly is called faasiq). Scholars have said that one who does not keep a Sunnah beard is a faasiq, as it is a sin not to follow the obligation.**\n* Preferably the one **most knowledgeable in Qur’an and Sunnah**\n* Preferably the one **most pious or respected** among those present",

Then the curfew, ik this is a basic one Lekin seriously why is the girls curfew like 10 pm and so serious to the point that u can't even reach at 10:01 (I'm not kidding) but for boys it's like Jo marzi karo, and why do girls need a frickn attendance system istg itni SARDI hoti I'm sleeping cozied up and bam I get spam called from these managers ke ao attendance lagwao LIKE TF?? Meanwhile boys have no such attendance system, girls if they go on an official trip that gets a little late we get fined like 1000 rs for no reason meanwhile boys who reached back at the same time get off scott free... seriously what in the misogyny. To make it worse we jus got new rules in girls hostel, NO MUSIC late night and nobody can use badminton court after 11 pm. Great like continues on the footsteps of being a literal jail.

            "Welcome to Pakistan! Plus I am an alumni. Humaray time pe itni sakhti nahi thi, badminton court was accesible all the time and terrace as well. Attendence was strict, they would even call our parents if somebody didnt mark attendance like for 2 hours",
            "I think most of the comments have summed up why these restrictions are a thing. Unfortunately, we live in a shitty country where shitty things can happen without repercussions. And again unfortunately, na NUST saraye mardon ko tameez seekha sakta hai aur na hi koi urr. \n\nSo the best way to protect someone is by enforcing really strict curfews. It may not be ideal, and you may feel like you are being treated like a child. But for NUST it's easier than explaining to your parents if something goes horribly wrong, so they take the path of least resistance.\n\nIf you want total freedom without oversight or restrictions, the only option is rent your own apartment outside. If you aren't ready to take that step, you are not ready to stay up past curfew as well.",
            "The whole reason behind this are the parents. The parents will be going to all extremes to blame it all on the hostel administration if something happens to their daughter, both in or outside the premises. And so, as a consequence, the administration has to put in these rules.\n\nThe problem, again, is that the desi culture is rotten to the core, to the point where just the thought of a woman doing something unconventional, such as going out after 9, is seen as a direct attack on family values and whatnot.",
            "People who have rooms near badminton courts have to sleep or study and it is not possible if someone is playing badminton. A friend of mine used to give random names to guards while entering university after 11 pm, they somehow figured it out and he was expelled from the hostel, The roof used to be closed when i used to stay in hostel years ago, (the rumor was they fear someone will commit suicide), terrace used to be open and it should stay open.",
            "Asal mein we need to understand dat we r living in a 3rd world country. We can never have any rights not even men are capable of almost anything here.\nWomen rights toh choro Yahan logon ko itni b sense nai hai k human right to choice and their freedom to live life on their own terms ka b nai pata....this is a paindu uncivilized country we r living in. Migrate or change this country. No other choice u have really.",
            "Sad but not surprised by the amount of people who agree with how this system should work. \n\nI understand women need protection, and that they need to be safe. Moreover, the issue for me isn't the badminton thing, but the permissions given to each gender in the same university. It is certainly hypocritical. Unfortunately, there are some concepts Pakistanis still seem to fail to wrap their heads around: independence and the **women's right to decide and choose.**\n\n1. Women are their own person. If they go out after 11, that's their responsibility to understand the consequences of their decisions. What i fail to understand is why this applies to men, and not women? Are women children who cannot make decisions for themselves? Okay, they need protection since this country harms women. But if we apply the same logic, men would also have to stay inside since they are able to be both harmed and harm someone. So the logic is immediately irrational by result.\n\n2. Pakistani parents. Some parents are also the problem where they start blaming the university administration when something wrong happens to the girl. If she goes out and gets harmed by a person, why is there no accountability? Why not simply hold the person who harmed her accountable? We grew up learning victim culture. This is a result of not giving severe punishments to abusers, and putting the attention on the victim (a culture rampant in Pakistan). The abuser gets away as a result. Every administration is too pussy, unfortunately.\n\n3. Whataboutism. I understand men can get harassed too. But this is about curfew times and allowing women to do what they want. Men have the freedom and independence. Women don't, over here.\n\nI am open for a discussion, and I can change my mind if the premises and the conclusion are logically consistent.",
            "Boys hostel terraces used to be closed as well. And yes we did get fines on coming late, but being friends with caretaker, he usually use to let us off the hook. And again, yes we did have attendance and rest of the restrictions you are talking about.",
            "Hey. \n\nI'll be attending your university insha'Allah for masters and seriously considering your hostels BECAUSE of these rules.\n\nYeah the terrace and attendance thing is a bit too much but with the rest of the security measures your parents are reassured that there is no chance of a mishap. \n\nAnd 10pm is curfew? My curfew at HOME is 5pm long distance and 7pm if I'm close to the house. My friends have tried making me late just to 'ease up' but it always backfired as I would still insist to be home. The true ones abide by the rules and believe me in the long run after I finished my undergrad, I came to realise everyone in my neighbourhood, family, and family friends, were keeping an eye on me. It paid off honestly. And I had a good night of sleep too!  So don't be too much pissed off by the 10pm cutoff on the curfew, okay? Just try scheduling everything around it. What can be done after 8 in the night can happen after 8 in the morning too.",

If it was a male in such case nobody would blame the admin.\n\nIf you dont like it ask your parents to write a written deed wherein the admin would not be responsible if something happen to you and move forward.\n\nAur no music wali baat yaqeenan ap hi ki kisi hostel wali behen ne complain ki hogi.\n\nAgr itni hi azaadi chahiye thi then should have gone to lums.\n\nBaki some rules I agree are too much magar in rules ko approve krne wali bhi tou koi aurat hi hai.\n\nAlso its not like all boys get off scott free agr apki nai banti apne hostel ki admin se tou isme boys ka kia kasoor wo tou bana ke rakhte hai chai pani pilate hai thats they get scott free sometimes",

        "body": "NUST is a 706 acre university. It is NOT FAST ke cafe ke directly upar library he.\n\nI want you to start walking half an hour every day to get used to it; especially if you're a hostelite and will be missing shuttles often.\n\nThe shuttle app is....workable. You'll find it on your LMS once you get it.\n\nYou'll be asked to bring your documents on day 1 of the orientation. Do not worry if you do not have them. Attestation zaroori hogi HEC se, even for FSc and matric originals (Yes, I know).\nPoora karo jab kar sakte ho.\n\nThe orientation will require you to sit a lot in a lot of places. Bring water (freeze it overnight - preferred), or if you're a cola junkie like me, wo bhi chalegi.\n\nUmbrellas in the sun - \"Wo to larkiyon ke Liye hotin\" - said the kid who got sunburnt 1 month in.\nLight ones preferred. Will save you a lot of misery.\n\nGym - Available for cheap. It's got good standards as it was made based on Jacaranda's gym.\nThe \"issue\" being the whole of NUST uses it.\nThere's also an old gym that's free but has sliiiiiiiightly broken stuff.\n\nFood - We have cafes known as Concordias (Shortened to C1, C2, C3 and so on).\n\nConcordias 1 and 2 are the same in shape. They have pretty good food.\n\nThey also have mini marts for daily use stuff.\nC2 ke first floor pe barber hein. His name is uncle Boota.\nHostels ke samne bhi hein. Idk them. Stay loyal to your barber.\n\nC3 is the Monal of NUST. You will find the atmosphere quite elegant. Except when it's hot.\n\nC4, unlike the others being buildings in their own right, is SMME's cafe. It's got THE BEST biryani.\nTHE. BEST.\n\nWe have issues on the naming rights of C5. Firstly, C5 is a canteen in SNS, which sells the most amazing fries and parathay you can find. There used to be something called the library cafe. It closed down but the staff migrated to SNS. C5 is also a canteen in the NSHS. They have good fries, but I don't think you'll be inclined to walk there more than once. Not that it's bad. It's just far.\n\nInnocafe is SINES and the NSTP's cafe. It has great roll parathas.\n\nThe Coffee Lounge is near C1. It is expensive, but has amazing food. Especially on the meetha side \n\nThe SCME cafe has great Chinese and a serene atmosphere.\n\nNICE ka shwarma was once the crown jewel of food in NUST. It still is, though people may say otherwise.\n\nNotice that I haven't spoken about the food available in C1, C3 and C3. Go on and try everything. Your taste buds may be different from mine.\n\nCommon rooms -  girls get common rooms everywhere.\nBoys, apart from NSHS, I think I've barely seen any. But you got God's green earth to sit anywhere.\n\nRagging - Ragging Kiya Hoti he?\nIcebreaking activities karwate ham to.\n\nTransport - For day scholars\nThere are two options;\nBaig transport \nUnited Transport Service\n\nI suggest UTS. When I used to go with Baig they didn't have air conditioning. I switched to UTS. They're better imo.\nBut obviously, to each his own.\nUTS office - C1.\nBaig office - C2.\nGo there right in your orientation, or even pehle.\nSome routes get buses. Others get vans. Depending on the number of people.\n\nAttendance - do not miss your classes casually during the first 2 months.\n75% attendance rakhna he.\n\nWhat some of our reluctant ladies and gentlemen preferred was to use their off-time in the first month. When real emergencies came, teachers refused to mark them present, leaving them to repeat the course. The 25% is for emergencies only.\nOr come in the first 3 months and bunk the last. Up to you.\n\nHostelites from afar - There's a student's initiative where a bus takes you directly to Lahore, Multan and another place. Idk if it will go on but it's there for now.\n\nAh yes, by the way - NUST has quite a bit of Multanis here. Mucho divertido.\n\nLanguage classes - You get offered a course for a language course (paid). It's extra and will take up your break for 2 days a week.\n\nBreak - NUST has an official break for everyone from 1 pm to 2 pm.\nHowever, barring engineers (software included) and doctors, everyone else has a chill life. If you're from S3H or NBS, your classes may as well be 9 am to 11 40 am in some cases.\nIdk about the others.\n\nArchitects and Industrial Design kids - hehehehhehehehehe what's a break hehehehehhehehehe\n\nOrientation Day - You will be put in teams called houses. Each house will be lead by an Orientation Leader (OL). Each house is divided into teams with numbers (**house name** 1, **house name** 5) led by an Orientation Guide (OG). Please report to them and do not argue no matter what.\nThey are students like you and will have been working for your orientation for months.\nI shan't reveal the orientation's surprises to you.\n\nMental health - I HATE therapy, but if you need it, C3A is there right in SADA (architects hehehehehhehe industrial design heheehehehehhehe). You may go to them not just for therapy but career counselling as well.\nThey're pretty good in both cases and do NOT give your personal info out to anyone.\n\nEvents and societies - all societies are run by students. All events are run by students. The orientation is by students, for students.\nSponsors are brought in by students. Everything is set up and run by students.\nYou too, will be a part of it.\nDo not listen to the person who says \"never join a society\". It will be your chance to interact with other schools' students for the rest of the year.\nDo not join more than 2 societies. You will not be able to work and study at the same time.\n\nEmail - Your NUST email will be something you need to keep active at all times. Your date sheets, society updates, news related to stuff - everything will be done here.\nSurveys - You will receive many emails about surveys on your mail. It's up to you to fill them or not. No need to respond if you do not want to.\nJust remember that you'll be there sending emails one day 😏\n\nYou will NOT forget the password for your LMS.\nThere are two types of LMS:\nLMS - for syllabus and uploads \nQALAM - For attendance and results\nThough uploads may shift to QALAM.\n\nEdits that I'll keep doing:\n\nTrail - NUST has a long trail around a km long. You'll be able to hike 9 am to 4 pm. A friend of mine used to do Zikr on some rocks there in the morning. It was serene.\n\nShuttles - NUST has a continuous shuttle service from one corner to the other. They only take a break 1-2 pm. It's free.\nDon't think the drivers are rude if they do not stop for you. You have to wave at them/call them out.\n\nThe NSTP (National Science and Technology Park) has a lot of tech start-ups. I've worked with quite a few of them. They offer internships for students.\nYou can also get your own startup there in incubation.\n\nI've done some edits to the food part as well.\n\nI'm bored so I'll stop for now. If you're away from your OG group in your orientation, we might catch up and have some ice breaking activities.....\n\nWelcome to NUST",

            "I'll add to this for those who are interested in playing sports for NUST or during their time at NUST.\n\nNUST has a sports directorate that manages sporting events and courts, etc although there aren't any coachs that hold training weekly( sad I know ). \nThere are two indoor basketball court that makeshifts as badminton and volleyball court aswell, known as old and new sports complex. We have several outdoor basketball, volleyball, tennis, football, cricket courts. All free for students. If you want to play in NBS ground there is a shed there where you can give your ID card in exchange for sports equipment same goes for the sports complexes. There is a small skating arena, next to wall climbing that open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturdays I think, squash court, swimming and Horse Riding is membership only it's 2k membership totally worth it. \nEach department has their own stuff aswell like seecs has table tennis, volleyball, badminton courts. You can borrow volleyball and badminton rackets from SEECS PG basement..\n\nTryouts are held for the football and basketball teams in the first few weeks of September. For Volleyball, NUST Volleyball League last year happened in September aswell. \n\nFor any sport in NUST, the inter department games \nare held between schools e.g SEECS vs S3H etc usually during the fall semester then the inter  collegiate championship is held between campuses of NUST e.g H-12 vs EME. Then each department has their own sports fest between batches e.g 2024 vs 2025. There are other home tournaments aswell like the NUST Olympiad, Haami Fundraisers, Leagues, etc. Then there are private tournaments around Islamabad University Olympiads, etc  but the teams have to self fund and travel by themselves there. There are also HEC Tournaments and more.\n\nPoint being if you are excited about sports the next four years hold loads of opportunities for you, studying is imp but don't stop yourself from doing things you want to do cuz parhai disturb ho gi. Manage your time and have fun you won't be this young again.",

        "body": "Recently I joined nust sub reddit and I saw a lot of posts about small cabinet size average mess etc. So I wanna share my experience hoping it may help you guys feel better with your life. I am 18 and my father passed away on june 17, 2017. I am the second eldest sibling I have an elder sister who's married and two younger sisters and one younger brother. My father was a government officer at WAPDA and we get pension of about 40k per month which is not enough. Initially some of my uncles from both sides helped but they soon lost interest and my mother is too self respectful to ask so we struggled. Government helped with some widow funds of about 20k for some time but soon the government changed and all previous policies were discontinued. At this I was in 9th grade and being in the government school I knew that I should get into a private college if i wanted to get some real education so I found a job after a year of searching. It was a work from home job which paid about 60k for 10 hours of work. So i started doing this and I got 958 in matric. I wanted to get into punjab college but their fee was too much so I ended up in superior. First year was good I worked supported my family, enjoyed college life but due to this got less than expected marks. In second year one of my friends introduced me to nust and I explored a lot of universities like comsats, pieas, but I couldn't get nust out of my mind. So I net-2 for first try and got 138 marks and I prepared and next time gave it for real and got 156. And now it was time to submit fee and I was so stupid I never thought of this aspect before. It never crossed my mind to at least check what the fee is. Long story short I couldn't get into uni bcz the expenditures were too much and I also lost my job and the only other one I could find was at a call center. At least i got pretty good marks in FSc and now I am learning python and am planning to learn software engg online. bcz i saw that many people are earning good without even a degree from a uni. I work day time at mall of sargodha as a salesman and night time in call center. And to me the word depression and sad always feels strange bcz we live in a country where if you walk outside you will hundreds of people who can't even make both ends meat. They really don't wanna tell anybody but after a certain point when your cloths become tattered your shoes become sewed over it becomes really hard to hide. For that I thank Allah that at least i am in a situation where i eat three times good food. Have a roof over my head and wear clean cloths. ALHAMDULILLAH  \nI hope this is able to help some people.",

My friend and I have been facing this problem since a while now and thought it best to post it here.  \nThe Principal of our school (ASAB) a short heighted man has been behaving extremely unprofessionally towards female students. First i went alone to his office to discuss some academic matter and he gazed at my body from head to tow in the most sleazy manner. Then he passed few unwarranted compliments and shers and about how i looked. Next time I took my friend along with me since I felt uncomfortable being alone with him and his audacity was the same. It looked like he wanted to talk about everything else besides studies. Sent some 'really friendly' texts at awkward timings and hes simply behaving like a predator. I want to report to some authorities but the problem is that he is the authority and I am scared that he will victimise me and ruin my grades if I expose his real face to the world. I have his texts as proof and some fellow students as witnesses.  \nHis name is Asghar. And please guide me how this can be reported while keeping my identity confidential.

Anyway, don't listen to people saying it would be difficult and all. The NUST apparatus has dealt with cases like these. In 2019, a retd army office serving as DD in SMME was sent home on same grounds. Similar cases in other depts have been dealt the same. I'd advice you to take the following route;\n\nDirect an email to the NUST HR, AD Legal, ProRector ACAD and Rector. Add your proofs of texts and screenshots of comments here sharing similar incidents with the principal. You can choose to be anonymous, but if you have to be, ask someone bold in this reddit to send this mail, you can also reach out to the alumni network as they can really press down hard without any fear of consequences. And ask them in this mail to conduct an investigation urgently as it is tarnishing the university's name online. That really riles up the top leadership.",

I didn't expect much, but they were surprisingly helpful. The complaint was forwarded directly to the Higher Education Commission (HEC), which sent a warning letter to my university. Although it wasn't a complete solution, it did help somewhat.\n\nThe best part about using the Citizen Portal is that your identity remains anonymous. No one can trace the complaint back to you. However, as a precaution, consider reporting from a different email address that doesn't include your name or can't be linked to you.\n\nIf you have proof to support your complaint, I strongly encourage you to share it with them. Unfortunately, I couldn't provide proof in my case because no one was willing to come forward and corroborate my story. I believe that if I had provided evidence, the authorities would have been even more helpful in addressing my concerns.",

Save any evidence: If there are inappropriate emails, messages, or other materials, keep them as evidence.\n3.

        "title": "The Ultimate Complete Hostel Guide for freshers",
        "body": "Hush my puppies do not fear, for i have come to provide you with every bit of knowledge you may possibly need before entering Nust hostels. Im making sure to make this a month early so all my children have time to prepare accordingly (both physically and mentally).\nSooooo where do i start? \n\nFirst of all you may have heard horror stories about the hostels but im here to assure you as a certified (ex) papa ki pari, its not that bad!!!! You definitely have to get used to them, but after a certain amount of time it comes naturally. Now moving on to an extremely important topic, ill begin with\n\n•FOOD🤝:\n\nokay so, \n\n1) mess food has good days and bad days, if ur a foodie lahori like me you'll definitely think its bland. Breakfast is typically paratha, anda, etc etc which id give a solid 6/10, lunch is definitely where they cut corners with daal most days or some sort of sabzi (3-4/10) whichto most students doesn't really matter since most days u dont come back to hostel for lunch, dinner is definitely the best with chicken karahi(bland), haleem, biryani (7-8/10 cuz its still quite bland).\n\n2) LUCKILY you can deliver food all night no issue but ofc not much is open at night typically you'd see OPTP, Dominos, cheezious McDonald's (pre-boycott) and some other shops open late at night so you'll definitely have enough options to get by but the delivery options to nust are limited in comparison to if ur coming from a central city.\n\n3) Its 5am now and nothing is open, uve run out of food and ur starving, what do u do now? No, not steal food from ur roommates, you go to the vending machine! Every hostel has a vending machine for students to enjoy random snacks at a slightly higher price (nothing crazy just like 30rs lays for 40). They are never really fully empty since they get restocked every couple days and they have boycott friendly options\n\n•ROOMMATES +ROOMS:🥵\n\n1) you have 2 other roommates who are bound to know every habit of yours whether they want to or not. Its okay if they're not ur insant bffs since sometimes it takes time for adult friendships to blossom and grow so dw!!! If for some reason you still dont like your roommate u CAN swap aslong as u find someone to swap with. Also ur stuff is relatively safe in the hostels since there are cctv cameras on 24/7 in the hallways. I personally didn't even own a lock and nothing ever got stolen. But if u have valuables better safe than sorry!!\n\n2) the beds and rooms are okay, maybe a tad bit small for three people but u learn to make it work and give it ur own charm.you can decorate them however you'd like to aslong as your mot poking nails in the walls. And yes the rumors are true in SOME(ayesha+zainab for girls)hostels there are only 2 closets with a third cabinet type thingy which genuinely is not enough space for all ur stuff. Who gets what is generally chosen by who comes first, the last unfortunate soul will just have to make do with the cards they were dealt(it was me, i unfortunately was the unfortunate soul ).\n\n3) Most older hostels have heaters while the new ones are still working on it. NO hostel has acs apart from in the common room. It does get extremely hot in Summers but ur allowed a cooler and also this is just one of the many things you get used to after a while. And before anyone asks ill just tell you that no ur not allowed to bring ur own acs. There definitely are a couple of brutal months but there is a comradrie like nothing else when you wake up at 3am and say to ur roomie \"bohat garmi hai bhai\" and then pass out again.\n\n4)Overall aslong as u respect your roommates space and clean up a little ull do okay!!! I know alot of you are about to have there first experiences of cleaning and to you i say good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\n\n•BATHROOMS:🛀\n\nChup chup shezaday mera pyaara freshie, rona nahi bilkul nahi rona abhi samjhati hoon kesay krna hai washroom\n\n1) the washrooms are just okay. Not horrible, they get cleaned twice a day and u make do. There are stalls for toilets(both kinds), and for showers. And then there are sinks separately. \n\n2)ill hold ur hand when i say this, there are separate sinks to wash ur plates and stuff inside the washroom which yes, is a little(alot) unhygienic to have them in the washroom. yes, everyone is aware of this and no, noone does anything about it. Its just one of those things u have to make do with.\n\n3)In the shower make sure to wear shower shoes. There is a water problem at nust during the summer which is much more prominent in the boys hostels than the girls ones(small win). But keep showering guys i believe in you, break those stereotypes!!!\n\n•AMENITIES:🤯\n\n1) on every floor theres a kettle, iron(only girls), and a microwave. All in slightly questionable states but definitely useable. \n\n2) every hostel has a laundry and ironing room on the ground floor where u can get ur clothes ironed (free for like 2 3 pieces daily) and washed(💲 and free both available but if u care about ur clothes at all ull spend that extra coin)\n\n3) theres a common room which has different stuff depending on which hostel ur in(may or may not have snooker/ludo/table tennis), and a gym which basic equipment like a treadmill and a couple of weights which are free to use.\n\n4) you can get ur room cleaned every few days and if stuff breaks u can write it in the complaint register which will get fixed eventually but that does take time in most cases.\n\n•UNSOLICITED ADVICE/RANDOM: 😵‍💫\n\n1) BE FRIENDS WITH UR MANAGER! Trust me itll help in the long term no matter how annoying they are.\n2) make a little basket for ur toiletries to bring to the shower.\n3) the better bond u have with ur roommates the better ur hostel experience.\n4) keep food in ur room at all times(i will come steal hehe)\n5) you need to get an outpass and mess off whenever ur leaving overnight where they call ur parents but not if ur coming back before curfew.\n6) curfew for girls is 10 which goes crazy amd is strictly enforced, for guys its 11 which is more of a suggestion than an actual curfew. Nust=sexist? my dear gentle readers, I'll leave that up for u to decide.\n7) you can get a fridge aswell(a mini one ofc not full size) but ull have to pay 500 extra for it each month.\n8) filtered water IS available for free in every dining hall, top floor and on the ground floor of every alternative hostel. But if u'd prefer mineral water u can also get that delivered from inside nust.\n\n\n•STUFF TO BUY/BRING:🤷\n\n1)kaprey ofc\n2) ur whole stock of underwear+socks\n3) bedsheets(×2 atleast) and a pillow \n3) hangers \n4) idk? Towels\n5) a baalti to wash clothers if thats something ur planning on doing urself \n6) a plate+bowl+spoon pho yo foooood\n7) dishsoap cuz u gotta wash those plates nasty ahh\n8)shoes+ shower shoes especially \n9) anything else you may possibly want to bring, theres nothing embarrassing about bringing a comfort plushie(i have three which reside on my bed)\n\nI think thats about all the knowledge i can think of that one may need before coming. If i missed anything let me know!!! And if u need any more elder sister(2nd year now:D) advice feel freee to DM whether its about hostels or nust overall!!!! \nOkay signing off,\nYour friendly neighborhood brainrotted girl",

I was getting slip from the counter in front of the juice shop when I felt someone properly bang into me. I looked around and saw no crowd whatsoever around and the person who banged into me was standing in front of me, laughing and clearly under influence. He kept referring to a girl, telling that she pushed him towards my side. He was laughing hysterically, with no sense of shame that he violated my personal space. Laughing, he just went about his way. While, I was still standing there, not out of my initial shock of being violated. Tears rolled into my eyes and I was shivering.\n\nAfter I relaxed my nerves for a while, I went towards his group and tried to confront him. But he kept looking at me with a creepy face, smirking. When I told that I can have a DC against him for potential harassment since he violated my personal space, he laughed at my face and pointed towards a girl telling me that she pushed him. There were 3 girls there and all of them were also laughing. Their faces were flushed and they kept looking at me with creepy expressions, not apologizing once. It was evident that they were under influence.\n\nA university is supposed to be a safe space for everyone. No one has the right to overstep anyone's boundary and violate anyone's personal space. My heart is still racing as I write this. I don't know their names and I just remember the boy's face, vaguely so I don't know what to do with it. I am just here to rant since I still can feel his touch on my arms and it's freaking me out. For most people, it'd be an intense reaction but this incident has triggered so many things that I can't explain. The way he was smirking when I told him that he violated my personal space, the confidence in his eyes that he would easily get away with it \n\nPlease remember!

        "subreddit": "nust",
        "title": "A Guide for NUST - From a Final Year Student",
        "body": "Hello Freshmen!\n\nFirst of all, congratulations on making it to NUST. I still remember the day my acceptance email came in ghar walon ki khushi, dost calling me nonstop, aur mei khud hawaon mei chal raha tha. You feel like life is about to begin, that university will be this grand adventure where you’ll discover who you are. And honestly, it kind of is.\n\nWhen I joined three years ago, I had this one thought in my head: *“Uni life ka full maza lena hai.”* I wanted to try everything. So I went all in  societies, events, MUNs, sports, random part time jobs, even debating and volunteering. Some days were amazing, some days exhausting, and of course, I made a lot of silly mistakes that I wish someone had warned me about.\n\nSo here’s the guide I wish I had when I first joined NUST.\n\n# 1) Academics\n\n“GPA matter nhi krta, skills ki saari game hai”  don’t fall for this trap. Yes, skills are super important aur ab workforce change bhi ho rahi hai, but trust me: keeping a decent GPA puts you in a much better position.\n\nMany companies auto reject resumes below a GPA cutoff.  \nMS abroad? Without GPA, no scholarships or good programs.  \nScholarships, awards, opportunities all need GPA.\n\nIs GPA everything? Nahi. But it’s an important part of the equation. First year is the easiest to maintain a good GPA, baad mei mushkil ho jata hai, so build your base now.\n\nAlso: har instructor alag hota hai. Learn their paper setting style, adjust accordingly. Don’t get into their bad books, but no need to be a teacher’s pet either.\n\nWork smart, grades will follow.\n\n# 2) Social Life\n\nNUST has one of the best social scenes in Pakistan. Don’t box yourself in with “mei introvert hun” ya “mei reserved hun.” This is your chance to grow. Trust me, everyone’s nice, you just need to say hi first.\n\nIf you’re lucky, good classmates make it easier.  \nGroups form early, toh baad mei left out wali feeling ho sakti hai. So talk to people, see kis se vibe match hoti hai.\n\nAur agar classmates se itna acha scene nahi hai, don’t worry. Bahar bohot opportunities hain to meet people.\n\n# 3) Societies & Events\n\nWelcome to NUST’s societies. Basically students with a common interest band together, take up roles, organize events.\n\nWhich societies to join?  \nAIESEC (hands down best, also international)  \nNCSC (super active, lots of events)  \nNMS (if you’re into music)  \nNiche ones: NDS (drama), NXC (excursions), NAC (adventure), NARC (archery), etc.\n\nHow to join? Follow Insta pages, fill forms, give interviews. Don’t stress, interviews bhi students lete hain.\n\nBut here’s a truth: NUST Events > NUST Societies  \nWhy? Events are short (2 to 3 months), less commitment, but huge learning and connections. Central events like NIMUN, Olympiad, NMF, NFL, Piston Cup are worth it.\n\nWhy join at all?  \nNot directly for your CV. I’ve done 10+ societies, countless events, and I don’t even list them. The value is in exposure and stories.\n\nIn interviews they ask: “Tell me a time you showed leadership or conflict resolution?” meri sari kahaniyan yahin se aati hain.\n\n# 4) Work & Learning Opportunities\n\nNUST has NSTP (National Science & Technology Park) on campus. Two ways to benefit:\n\nInternships or part time work: Check company list, email them, ya directly walk into offices with your CV. 10 mein se 1 to 2 will hire.  \nStartups: If you have an idea, pitch at FICS or apply to Hatch8. Real funding and resources milte hain. Students have built companies like Inlights, EcoBricks, Vyro.\n\n# 5) Cafes & Activities\n\nFood: C1 general vibe, C2 chowmein, S3H roll paratha, NICE shawarma, C4 biryani, NSTP cafe best food, Coffee Lounge for vibe, C3 chai and view.  \nGym: Sports Complex gym (paid, 1k per month, worth it). S3H gym (free but meh).  \nSaddle Club: Horse riding at dirt cheap rates.  \nExtras: Bowling, language courses (German, French, Turkish), minors in other majors, exchange programs (not fully funded but worth it), trips (solo bhi chale jao, important).\n\n# Final Advice\n\nYour time here will fly by. You’ll meet people from all kinds of backgrounds. Learn to get along, decide what you want out of uni life.\n\nGood job after graduation?  \nStartup or business?  \nJust memories and fun?\n\nPlan accordingly. Don’t just go with the flow. Who you know is more important than what you know. Be social, stay optimistic, and opportunities will come.\n\nAnd please document your uni life. Take photos, silly videos, TikToks. After this, practical life hits hard, and you’ll wish you enjoyed more.\n\nThere is so much more i wanna talk about but is post ko itna hi rehne deete hein..\n\nIf you need anything, notes (especially NBS freshies), ya wanna know about events, jobs, networking , socializing, uni me koi masla aarha hou ya need someone to talk to my DMs are open. Message me, I’ll help out.\n\nBest wishes to all of you!",

            "Edit: I have added a follow up comment to show the flip side of coin as well :)\n\nTotally agree with you, having worked with Forbes 500 companies and having mentored/interviewed individuals, I understand where this hate comes from. SEECS used to be one of prestigious schools where you actually find GEEKS passionate about tech and amount of pre-meds I have seen who know shit about tech AND ALSO ARE’NT INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING TECH EITHER. The complicated mathematics is one step further. What I have come across is a bunch of kids who think they can just get away with good grades, heck no! This field requires passion and out of class learning, even a pre engineering student who gets a 4.0 will struggle to get a job if he/she isn’t passionate about field and ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS THE TECH STACKS BEYOND CLASSROOM. \n\nI wish this Pakistani culture of “back up” fields end and people actually pursue what they are passionate about, no one had it easy with boomers, most of us had to put a fight for our passions so could they as well instead of excuses.\nScope isn’t limited of many fields even in Pakistan. Its the incompetences of graduates who then shout “iss field ka tou scope hi ni hai”\n\nSo yeah, I agree with OP. Put such students in interview and you instantly see neither passion for tech nor understanding of how it all works but degree tou mil gaye na onko course work raatt ke.\n:)\n\nNo hate for any pre-med or pre-engg but if you ain’t passionate about a field you are just depriving probably a passionate geek of what he/she deserved and could have done way better in industry than you, without passion, graduating on that seat.",

Stupidity ki bhi had hoti hai programming field is one of the most logic based fields in which you cannot do ratta and get by because they are based on peoblem solving skills.

        "body": "A year ago, I was 100% set on going into AI. I loved tech. Architecture wasn't even on my radar. It felt too artsy, too abstract, and honestly, not \"me.\"\nMy older sister, though, is an architect. She kept dropping hints about how architecture could still be technical, how it involved problem-solving, systems thinking, and even aspects of engineering when you get deep into it. I brushed it off at first. I thought she just wanted me to follow in her footsteps.\nLong story short, after a lot of confusion about choosing AI in different unis and architecture in nust, I ended up giving architecture a shot. Fast-forward to now, I'm deep into my first year, pulling late nights on studio projects, learning digital modeling, sketching concepts, and weirdly enough I'm thriving.\nI didn’t think I’d ever say this, but I’m glad my sister nudged me. I still love tech, but for now, I’m just enjoying the ride and letting myself fall in love with architecture.\nJust wanted to share in case anyone else is torn between fields. Sometimes, the thing you resisted most ends up being exactly where you’re supposed to be.",

I get that you have worked hard to plan everything for us but you chose it voluntarily and we as freshies have the choice to have fun our way too voluntarily, so don't be rude to us or show us attitude like we owe you guys anything.

I would question security guards, go through an hour of footage and try to figure out camera angles. There was a camera in the mosque that was turned off by the request of HEC. The guards didn't know anything and the footage had terrible resolution. Not to mention the sheer number of people entering and leaving the mosque with a non description bag make it impossible to find the thief. \n\nIn the end, my investigation failed.

Yr 2022\nNow fast forward to 2024 I asked this Nustrive guy if I can teach a sub to social sciences students since I got really good marks in my NET and he asked me for my cv and all and then after lengthy but totally irrelevant talks he tells me he's going to pay me 15K for designing a course and it's going to be an internship. And I was supposed to design this with the tutor who himself was a freshie then. Had one sitting with the fcking tutor and felt bad for the students who would be paying him to prepare for NET. The working environment was so toxic, this freshie would misbehave with me all the time and tell me to rush things or I wouldn't get paid. I told the owner to ask him to apologize to me and he did nothing. At the top of everything he also told me to lie about where I did my NET prep from and if someone asks take Nustrive's name. But I still went on to record a testimonial for the person I went to for my prep bcs why the hell would I lie. \nAnyways worst way of earning some cash and I'd not recommend working with that person at all.",

            "From your replies, I've observed that you are targeting FAST as it teaches you \"skills\" and prepares you to take on the computing world. This couldn't be farther from the truth, Fast grooms you to become a corporate slave, it restricts you from using your creative skills, and forces you to keep on doing what you're told. Also it lowers your chances of leaving this country to go for a better future with endless opportunities. Fast, Nust, Lums name any trending uni they just help you land your first job, the actual skills are learnt by own not through the uni syllabus. After your first job, everybody asks about your experience and any real world projects, not your gpa, not your uni.",
            "RemindMe! 1 year",
            "bro if you’re choosing FAST over LUMS and NUST*after* getting into both, that already shows you know what you want. like it’s not an easy choice but it’s a bold one. Not everything’s about hype or brand  sometimes it’s about where you’ll actually *grow*.And idk why ppl in the comments acting like he made some huge mistake. He’s not a kid. he knows what FAST is like. if he’s chill with the ragra and even *wants* it because it preps you well, then what’s the problem??we act like FAST is the only uni with ragra go ask iit delhi or bombay kids what real ragra feels like. and bro in the end we all gotta face a world where companies can hire anyone from anywhere. So if he’s choosing the grind now that’s smart af. It’s *his* uni life, *his* career let him breathe lol.  \nhope it works out exactly how you want it bro, may Allah bless the whole journey 🤍",
            "Been lurking in these uni subs for a long time. I've been in the industry for like 4-5 years. Anyone saying ke FAST makes you a corporate slave is in an illusion as I haven't seen any NUST graduate make big in IT. Its the contrary. Its the FAST corporate slaves that end up making their own start ups in like 5-6 years in the industry. The name of the university is sadly still a VERRRRRYYYYY big consideration for many big IT companies and you have to admit that FAST/ LUMS does have a very good repo in those companies. Although NUST does come second. If you're considering anything related to university ragra/campus life/social life in your decisions, do keep in mind that these are only 4 years of your life and you'll be in the industry for the rest of your life and the starting 10-15 years of that experience is highly influenced by the name of your university. 90% graduates from NUST that do not want to become a corporate slave will end up in the same jobs as FAST graduate with 10-20% less pay and less growth. Being a FAST graduate also enables you to play on multiple job offers where you can negotiate better on salaries even as a freshie. Secondly losing GPA because of ragra is a myth. Your GPA will be what you earn in the long run.\n\nSo don't worry about the campus life in FAST. Try to get internships in your 2nd/3rd/4th year. Focus on your career. You'll leave these unis behind in your memories",
            "When you take accountability for something, you try to prove yourself by giving your best no matter the odds and this is what i see in your decision. Nust or fast, you'll make it through InshAllah.",

            "Honestly Guys, let the man decide where he wants to go please try to respect some people's decision because it's their own, instead of bashing them with your own choices or preferences.",
            "Despite knowing that you'll go through the ragra in FAST and your gpa will also drop drastically, you are still opting to go there ? I would've chosen otherwise",

            "Hey, Im seeing a lot of these if you go to fast you can't go abroad posts and comments and I just wanna say my brother is Inshallah going to Germany this year for his masters and also secured a really good cgpa at fast. It's not as hard as people make it out to be. He has the best programming skills I've seen, and yes he's done online courses and self study but he credits the assignments and tests with helping him strengthen his skills. They're built to make you think like a computer scientist more based on problem solving skills which is exactly what all companies are looking for. He and all his friends are also working remote high paying jobs at companies based abroad. Whatever these people on Reddit are saying is bs. If you're good at what you wanna do and have the will for it you're gonna make it big. So Goodluck at fast and with your future! :)",

My father was the one who told me my first priority is your education but when the time came the story flipped. There might be few financial crisis I totally understand I refused the offer and then later on applied to IBA but unfortunately couldn't get in. I applied to giki and got accepted for bscs, my mother was in the hospital I stayed with her day and night and I just got a day to prepare for giki test despite that I managed to clear it. When the results came out can you guess what they said?( Congratulations that you got accepted but we cannot send you). I cried in front of them but nobody listened. There wasn't a single day I betrayed my parents trust even to the extent that I don't even talk to boys but I guess it was of no use. I applied to nust and got in for mechanical engineering but my father tells me this isn't the field you should pursue. Later on my least Option was left for CS I got accepted there(I will be going there now) it's a business university particularly and not even famous. Why the hell did I went through all those struggles for clearing those university tests( agar mujhay pata hota ye hona hai mere Sath main kabhi mehmag hi nahi karti). I wish if I would have gotten parents who understand me , all of my friends are going to good universities and m stuck here in hell despite being accepted. Not a single day goes without having these thoughts, nevertheless the only thought that comes to my mind from frustration is that I will not stay in that house once I graduate. They keep on telling me they love me but I guess they don't understand me. ",

            "Salam girl,\n\nI have had similar life experiences but it was almost 9 years ago back in 2016. However, partly it was on me too. I couldn't get into any med school and had to choose a local uni eventually because bad grades etc and also because I was kinda heartbroken over not being able to get into uni. \n\nI used to resent my parents back then too that why they did this, why they did that. Why am I not allowed to study and travel in other cities like my whole circle went? All my friends were either studying in top med schools or other top unis like NUST, LUMS etc. And I was stuck here in a local uni. \n\n9 years down the line, even though I do realize my parents could have done better than that but please, don't listen to any of these people out there telling you to rebel against your parents. The world is pretty ruthless for young kids (be it boys or girls). Having parents who are out there looking out for your safety  is a blessing in this day and age. Even if you are not feeling that they are thinking the best for you, leave it on Allah. Because Allah knows what's best for you. Trust Allah in this process and just accept what your parents are asking you to do right now. \n\nWhen we are studying in uni, we need peace of mind because the curriculum isn't gonna be easy to follow. The stress levels are high. On top of that, if you have to live alone, it becomes even more stressful.\n\nNow that I hear stories of my friends and fam who studied in hostels and the kind of experiences they have had, I realize now that I really wasn't ready to have had those kind of life experiences. \n\n\nJust in case you may know, after 9 years, I will be going to NUST now in sha Allah in September for pursuing my MS. You will get many more such chances too. But now that I am going with more maturity and outlook towards life, I am realizing it is not at all easy to leave everything behind and just go and have a hostel and chill life out there even if it has been your dream all your life. \n\nHaving said that, believe me when I am saying this because I am saying with experience that don't rebel against your parents. If getting into a top tier uni is your dream then you will get into it one day. You will always have so many other chances to work towards your dreams and everything. But right now, you gotta be mature enough and accept your parents' decision for yourself even if you think it's not right because life out there is not easy either. We all think grass is greener on the other side. But it is not.",

Mass communication isn't just about throwing some pretty images together; it's about crafting a message, communicating a narrative, and connecting with an audience. What is the core message of this video? Is it Pepsi is cold? You failed to make me feel that connection to the brand. You have demonstrated a lack of understanding of the audience. You have made no effort to convey why Pepsi should be the drink they choose. Instead you make us focus on how wet the can is? Great, we all understand that soda cans can be wet?\n\nThe use of colors is also amateurish. You think just throwing color on everything is enough? Colors must be considered in terms of the product, the message, and the audience, but you've just done what you thought was visually \"interesting.\" The fact you are using the same flat and poorly diffused lighting with a color filter is not impressive. Instead of being dynamic and interesting, it is bland and amateurish.",

            "I'll explain it all if you are willing enough to read all the nerdy stuff I am about to spout. \n\nMen are visually and physically driven. If he finds her even remotely attractive, his brain will tag her as a potential mate, whether he admits it or not. He might suppress it for the sake of the friendship, but it’s still simmering under the surface.\nWhen a guy opens up emotionally, something he doesn’t usually do with other men, that connection starts feeling special. He gets validation, comfort, understanding... and his brain confuses it with romantic attachment.\nMost men don’t get genuine emotional care or attention from women unless romance is involved. So when a girl treats him with warmth and presence, it hits different. He start thinking, \"she gets me\", \"she is different\" and boom 💥  there you go! \n\nEven if the girl means pure friendship, friendly teasing, affection, or physical closeness (like hugs) can blur the lines for him. He starts wondering “what if…”\n\nIf other guys show interest in her, his protective “friend” mode sometimes mutates into jealousy. That’s when he realizes \"oops! too late, I am not just a friend.\"\n\nOnly self-aware men can keep the friendship long term and even then, they also tug sometimes.\n\nBasically: Men and women can't be \"just friends\" unless the attraction never existed. Which, I'd say is very rare unless you are unattractive and I don't think you are considering you have been asked out various times.",

I'm really sad that the post got hijacked by useless men claiming that it is all for women safety when clearly the issue didn't involve them whatsoever.\nI'm making a follow up post to share further experience regarding the girls hostel and how it continues to be awful. So my mother came to Islamabad and took me to the visa office because I had to get my visa to visit my dad out of country, I was with my mother and brother the whole day and since Paki visa offices suckk with time management issues I ended up being way too late to reach my hostel in time for the 10 PM curfew, so my mom calls the manager and tells her ke yea she will be spending the night with me even though she doesn't have outpass it's all chill scene and the manager is like yes all good. MIND YOU I'm with my mom and the manager knows this. Despite this I get a fine of RS 1000 at my doorstep for so called leaving for a day without the outpass. I don't understand how a stupid piece of paper has sm value over a literal phone call from my own mother that you must fine me rs fuckn 1000 but sure. \nRecently I went out of NUST and then I ended up getting rlly late bcz of them indrive issues. I reach NUST gates at 10:02 pm and immediately am subjected to constant questioning by the guard. Then I reach my hostel and once again the guard subjects me to entering my name in the form with my entire family history so I can be fined AGAIN for what being like 10 MINUTES LATER THAN THE CURFEW. And then I go to the Manager's office to hear her threaten me to revoke the hostel. I can't believe this bullshit bcz at this point this is not for the so called safety of women this is just terrorizing the girls and extorting as much money as they can from their parents. And the fact that guys aren't subjected to this much nonsense pisses me tf off.",

            "Until last year, guys didn't have to mark their attendence, or get an outpass for leaving. It sucked big time because whenever I'm out with my guy friend, my panik starts kicking in the moment it's 9:50, whilst he's chill because he has more than an hour to stroll around campus. If women's presence INSIDE the campus past 10 pm poses safety issue, maybe it's best to make boy's curfew 9pm because the VERY thing women are at danger by ARE men especially if it's INSIDE the campus. What other threats are there for women to stay past 10pm inside the campus?",

I opened my books, I had to do chem and biology 1st year, 2nd year and English too. I didn't sleep much for those 4 days, gave it my all. (Didn't study for English btw kya ajeeb, I studied English in the car going to nust lol) \n\nKher I gave the entrance exam with 0 sleep, empty stomach (i had cold coffee for breakfast and i threw that up too ED gang) and itna bura headache I can't explain \n\nUdher ja k bhai mujhy ek lafaz samajh nahi aaya, I knew biology, wo kiya, did English jo samajh aaya and raw dogged chem. Slept for an hour. \n\nBhai ye sab karne k baad bhi mere 112 numbers thay 😭😭 (I should've studied harder and earlier but like expected 4 Din parh k kya hi kar lena tha maine) \nI was SOOOO sure k mere achy numbers aa jayen gy just because I trusted Allah won't ignore my dua. I'm still a little sad about that but everything happens for a good reason bhai I can't be grateful enough. \n\nI applied in qau, my childhood bestfriend, who was about to give mdcat, cancelled her plan to do mbbs and her parents had one condition of letting her study in a different city, that she studied with someone she knew. I am her ONLY friend who she can apply with, I talked to her parents and we applied tgt. If not for my nust ki rejection I would've applied in gcu or somewhere else. \nThis is all I could ask for, she's so close to my heart and so precious I can't imagine her going to uni alone or not going at all. \n\nThe point (I wrote sm wth) but the point is u NEVER know what's good for you. You did your best, now let Allah choose what he thinks is the best for you. He knows you more than you can ever know yourself. He's closer to you than your jugular vein and loves you more than 70 mothers, I don't think any mother would want their kid to be sad, considering they knew the future. \nAllah knows your future, and He is the best planner. Trust in him and pray you stay on sirat e mustaqeem. \n\nI'll pray for you too <3",
            "Back in 1st year i studied way too hard bcz i knew this was the shot i had to take and mostly unis will count my 1st year marks in their aggregate \n\nAnd i got 388 marks there i was disappointed, a bit sad, awhole lot of frustrated... then that one teacher... (cuz that one person is always there somehow to lift u up😅) \nHe gave one of the best thing I've ever heard\n\"MEHNAT KA SILAH KABHI NUMBERS SY NHI MILTA\"\n\nyour life is almost predestined and its written that which ur choices will get you to which outcomes ofc prayers to ALLAH Almighty can act as multiple door opening to desired outcomes but in most cases GOD knows whats right\n\nU worked hard u didn't get the what u wanted but u will get the reward later when u realise how much lucky u were that Allah chose something else which was farr better than Nust \n\n\"INDEED he is the best of planners\"\n\nI believed in all his process and I've left it up to him.. I'll work hard as much as i can and whatever results he chooses is best for me and intil now I've been greatly satisfied with all his decisions \n\nI repeated my 1st year got 497 i gave my NET worked just hard enough and got 72% and till the merit list all hopes on him....",

            "Yes it was your dream. But ask yourself why was nust your dream? Cuz its number one and u wanna be on the top? More opportunities? Better job placements? Better connections? Better future? This is how I calmed myself as well. Allah ne apka rizq un jagaon mei bhi likha hota jahan apko tasawur bhi nahi hota. Rastay bananay wala Allah hai. Dont rely on the means. Rely on Allah. U dont need NUST to be happy or successful or meet good people. All the happiness and success thats due for you will reach you even from the paths you block for yourself because they feel scarier to walk on or unfamiliar cuz u never planned on taking this route.",
            "heyy, i totally get how you feel, this must be so devastating specially after taking a gap year, but one thing that i do know for sure and youre also aware of that is the fact that this was not written for you and something else and something greater is in your naseeb, i know it sucks rn but its really not the end of the world, and i know it doesnt make any sense lekin after a few months or maybe years you’ll see why did all of this happen, this is not a rejection but a redirection from allah. youve done everything in your power and sila tou allah ke haathon mein hota hei na , and he never leaves you empty handed, you will see inshallah how things will work out for you in the end, stay strong <33 everything will be alright",
            "I won't make it to Fast Lahore. And tbh i feel like I don't even deserve it, cuz even if I ace my entrance exam I knew my fsc will show me the fruit for \"not working hard enough\". Yes my ability to ace entrance exams is getting better but idk i was never able to do good in Fsc. I wasn't used to ratta. And yes even after a gap year I won't make it to Fast all cuz of being horribly bad at Fsc, even though I plan to give improvement and Net 1 in December as a last option (ONLY if my parents let me cuz I know they're disappointed in me). You worked hard bro, you're far more knowledgeable now as compared to Net 1. The way you're trusting Allah is so pure mashallah. Many are able to achieve 160+ in Net but only a few are able to achieve high trust in Allah. You should be proud you worked hard unlike me.",

        "body": "HELLO AND SALAM EVERYONE.THIS POST IS ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF SEECS,NUST AND IS MEANT TO GIVE YOU A REALITY CHECK. I HAVE COMPILED A LIST OF POINTS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND THOSE OF MY PEERS AT NUST PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY,IT WILL HELP YOU A LOT.\n\n1)THE FACULTY AT SEECS IS NOTHING LESS THAN TRASH,MOST OF THE GOOD FACULTY HAS LEFT SEECS(EXAMPLE SIR YASIR FAHEEM,SIR ARSALAN,SIR HASAN ALI KHATTAK AMONG OTHERS).\n\n2) IN MY ENTIRE DEGREE APART FROM 4-5 PROFESSORS,MOST OF THEM WERE REALLY BAD.WE HAD A PROFESSOR BY THE NAME OF AHSAN SADAT(YOU CAN SEARCH HIM UP ON THE INTERNET) WHO TAUGHT US DSA,THE GUY WOULD LITERALLY READ SLIDES OF A SUBJECT WHICH INVOLVES A LOT OF SUBJECTS.WE HAD A DATABASE PROFESSOR AND I CAN SWEAR ON MY LIFE THAT THE GUY DIDNT KNOW A WORD HE WAS TEACHING.\n\n3)IN SEECS ,SOME PROFESSORS WOULD TEACH YOU  BASIC CONCEPTS IN CLASS AND THEN GIVE YOU A REALLY DIFFICULT MID TERM/FINAL PAPERS.EXAMPLE PROFESSOR DAUD ABDULLAH,TAUGHT US MACHINE LEARNING ,AVERAGE PROFESSOR BUT REALLY STRICT WHEN IT COMES TO GRADING.\n\n4) MOST OF THE COURSE CONTENT IS THE SAME (NO CHANGES)AS MY SENIORS HAD 7  YEARS AGO.\n\n5)LAB TASKS WERE OUTDATED AND PATHETIC.I MEAN THESE LAB TASKS ARE NOT RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY WORK AT ALL.\n\n6)THE ENVIRONMENT AT SEECS IS TOXIC,THE STUDENTS ARE ALWAYS PUSHING TO GET GOOD GRADES. ZERO SOCIAL LIFE.\n\n7)THE GRADING IS REALLY BAD.I MEAN IF THE TEACHER WANTS HE/SHE CAN GIVE YOU A C+ AT AVERAGE INSTEAD OF B,NO ONE CAN QUESTION HIM/HER. E.G IN A SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING COURSE , I WAS ON AVERAGE AND GOT a C+ GRADE INSTEAD OF a B GRADE.THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE.\n\n8)SEECS HAS A BUNCH OF REALLY SMART STUDENTS AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE 4 NET'S CONDUCTED  AND SOME OF THESE STUDENTS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL BRILLIANCE GET SCHOLARSHIPS ABROAD OR GET REALLY HIGH PAYING JOBS IN GOOD COMPANIES.NUST TAKES THE CREDIT FOR THIS WHEREAS THE REALITY IS OPPOSITE(IT'S BECAUSE OF THOSE BRILLIANT STUDENTS NOT BECAUSE OF NUST.\n\n9) IF YOU ARE READY TO WORK YOUR ASS OFF  ALL ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT EXPECTING MUCH HELP FROM THE TEACHERS IN A REALLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT ,WELCOME TO SEECS.\n\n10)IN MY OPINION ,SEECS DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE IN TOP 500 LET ALONE WHATEVER QS RANKING IT IS.AFTER ATTENDING SEECS FROM 2020-2024 I HAVE STOPPED BELIEVING IN RANKINGS,I THINK IT'S ALL A HOAX AND COMPLETE B.S.\n\nIN CONCLUSION , I WOULD LIKE TO TELL ALL THE INCOMING FRESHMEN AND ASPIRANTS TO COME OUT OF THIS SMOKE SCREEN AND FAKE IMAGE OF SEECS. IT'S AN ORDINARY /AVERAGE DEPARTMENT LIKE ALL OTHER CS DEPARTMENTS OF DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES OF PAKISTAN. STOP GLORIFYING IT,IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT IS.\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT MATTERS IS YOU IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH YOU WILL  SUCCEED IN LIFE NO MATTER IF YOU GRADUATED FROM AN AVERAGE UNIVERSITY !",

            "Hold up. I'm a NUST grad ans everything you are saying was true for us even when we were inducted back in 2015. So its always a shit show everything in the world is becoming trash. And I agree with the NET 4 and the shit load of students applying, the merit system and not increasing seats and not improving quality of entrance test, NUST in general is becoming a fluff. But number 9. You said if you want no support from teachers and work your ass off-- kid, you are done with your FSC and Alevel, you are as good as someone is in the job marrket, alone, struggling on your own, figuring things out. Who says k kisi b university level student ko TEACHERS se help milni chahiyeh? Not anywhere in the world does a university student claim to be so babied k ussko hath pakar kar parhaya jaye. You passed 12th, get out of the bubble k ab apko koi aa kay hath pakar k bachaye ga. The course, the content, the labs, the internships, nahi pasand arai, khud jao logon ki minnatain karo yeh waqt hai bajaye isskay k job k time per minnatain karni parain. Seekho hoa tou BE on your own. Get courses, apply to exchange programs, aur departments main dosti karo dekho log kin kin programmes main enrolled hain abroad ja k exchange semester b kartay hain uss se seekhtay hain. In my 4 years at NUST, I saw jisney rasta banana hota hai ussnay kisi buhut low merit department jahan ki facility bilkul trash thi, wahan per beth k apna rasta bana lia q kay ussnay khud skills uthayeen, network banaya, yeh nahin rota raha k teachers nay nahin parhaya. I also saw logong ney 5, 6 semesters achi faculty aur best department k sath extra laga k b kuch nahin kia. Humara obsession k humain koi saviour koi aa kay bachaye ga humain le dooba hai. Parents yahan sabko 40, 50 saal tak ki age per support kartay hain jis waja se hum main itni self reliance nahin ati k hum ab 12 k bad khud apnay bal bootay per kuch b karain. Bachay teachers ab gaye apka kaam hai apnay own per kuch bano. Chahay ro ro k chahay rasta bana k. Samaj jao warna 16 saal ki parhayi main b agar kisi ko teacher's ko rona hai tou Allah hi hafiz hai humari qaum ka I am seeing 10 years worth of experience professionals literally thinking k unko aa kay koi job per lagaye ga hath pakar kar. Aesa nahin hai. This is the real world now. Deal with it.",

I am doing research with some Phd peeps from US and South Korea and i asked them about there bachelors like how much babied they got by there professors and all of them said we didn't professors come deliver lecture and go that's how they spent there bachelors and these guys were not from some unknown small unis 1 of them did bachelors from KAIST.\n\nAnother thing they mentioned was whatever they have done so far is due to the extra effort they put in by working with different professers in there labs lectures don't teach you much speically if you are interested in that specific domain because class is of 50+ students and not all of them can study certain subject in much detail. \n\nEven in SEECS it is kinda the same you don't really know much from lectures only surface level knowledge but to gain more you can work with professors and they mostly welcome you and help you alot. I barely know any alumini who got into good Grad School or got into some really good companies after graduation and didn't work in any labs.",

        "body": "Dear NUST Admissions (if you can even be called that),\n\nLet me just say this outright: what the actual fuck was that disaster of an interview process?\n\nI don’t know if you're actively trying to humiliate applicants or if incompetence just flows naturally through your system like oxygen, but either way, **well done**. You’ve officially wasted my time, energy, money, mental health, and bandwidth in ways that not even load-shedding could rival.\n\nYou made us apply months in advance, hyped up your overblown entrance process, made people *physically* travel to Islamabad for an extra test—and then when it came to the interview? A rushed, robotic, five-minute performance where you couldn't have made it clearer that decisions were already made and we were just there to fill your formalities. You could’ve just sent us an automated rejection letter instead of insulting our intelligence.\n\nAnd then- oh, the cherry on top- you ask me what I’d do if I *don’t* get a hostel. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? That was your priority? Not my academic interests, not my experience, not why I even chose this damn field—but “What if you don’t get a hostel?” News flash: if I don’t get a hostel, I don’t come. Full stop. My parents weren’t even on board with Islamabad in the first place—I sold them this dream of NUST *because* of your so-called secure accommodation. And now, you just casually throw in “oh you might not get one” at the very end? As if it's a minor detail?\n\nAnd let's talk about your *pathetic excuse for scheduling*. First you give me a slot for July 21st at 10 AM. I cancel everything. Nothing happens. Then an email: “It’s rescheduled to the 22nd.” Fine. I rearrange again. Then ANOTHER email—“Nope! It’s on the 23rd now.” Are you actually serious? Are you just rolling dice at this point? You made me beg another university to reschedule their interview just so I could attend yours—how absolutely humiliating. And for what? So you could nod for five minutes and end the call like you're late for lunch?\n\nYou’ve got some nerve presenting this disaster as a “prestigious” selection process. The only thing prestigious here is the level of mismanagement.\n\nSaale kuttey.\n\nEdit: Didn't get in guys :( ngl that \"Not Recommended in MS in Clinical Psychology\" really hurt :(",

            "Im so sorry that you had to go through all this. In which particular program did u apply?",
            "man, I have got so much frustration bottled up when it comes to NUST’s hostel management.. like seriously, what even is this system? some matric kid with basic math skills could handle it better.\n\nevery year, NUST proudly launches new degree programs, shiny new schools, but somehow forgets the part where those students need a place to live.. like bro, its basic logic if you introduce new programs, that means new batches every year. that means more hostel applicants, but guess what? s**ame number of hostel seats.** no expansion. no planning. just vibes.\n\nnow add the whole new NSHS school into the mix.. five-year degree programs, full-time campus presence and surprise surprise, still no new hostel space. so whats the genius move? Cram everyone into existing hostels, then quietly push out postgrad students because hey we are not paying more than 2 million per year like the med school students, right?\n\nits honestly laughable. no PG hostel policy now, because lets be real, they would rather give those rooms to high-paying students. and we are just left here, juggling research and 10+ hour lab days with zero stability. its giving: “we love new admissions and all the money but don’t you dare ask where it goes” \n\ni am honestly so fkn mad typing this. but I know its a lost cause bringing it up here.. nothings gonna change. just needed to vent. what a clown show of a system... chutiya management fr",
            "lets be fkn honest.. as an MS student, I deadass got baited into thinking NUST actually provides single-seater rooms for postgrad students. “NUST is elite,” “top-tier environment,” “safe and secure internal hostels” all that. and yeah, I will admit, the security and vibe *inside* the hostels is unmatched.\n\npostgrad students spend insane hours in labs and mine’s the Applied Biosciences department, in case you don’t know... this degree ain’t your chill-and-graduate type.. it’s a full-time mental breakdown... all our seniors look like walking corpses from the research load.. like no joke, legit living dead.\n\nfirst, they told us, “hostel mil jaega after first semester.” cool. we waited. after that? “no free rooms. wait for another semester.” seniors said one whole floor was empty at that point but the DD Hostels guy (some army dude with a micro-sized brain and full dictator mode) straight-up lied like a pro “No rooms available.” 🤡\n\nthen construction started.. new blocks, extra floors and they hit us with “hostel mil jaega in 2nd year when research starts.” alright. fast forward.. my research has started, and guess what? They just told us they are not giving hostel accommodation. at all.\n\nlike??? I have never seen this level of sh\\*t management.. the audacity to keep lying to your face while doing whatever the hell they want. ISTG, NUST may be a “brand,” but the way they treat MS students is straight-up disgraceful.",
            "Sorry you had to go through all this. I get it....I had to push hard just to apply for MS at NUST even though I live here. These crazy tuition and hostel fees are honestly messing with us. It feels like they’re not even taking students seriously anymore.",
            "I got admission in MS structural Engineering and for me the process was easy. It hardly took 15 mins to apply and 10 mins to submit documents after confirmed selection. I believe the department specific to you has some issues. And yes the hostel thing has pissed me off too.",
            "you guys are giving interviews? Wtf ... I got enrolled (not going, sidenote) without an interview!?",
            "What is your merit position? I was actually shocked at how fast they were conducting the interviews—literally just 5 minutes! I had heard from seniors that interviews usually last 15 to 30 minutes, but nope, they were done in just 5. I was really surprised how they could assess someone's knowledge in such a short time.",
            "This response by NUST literally is ridiculous",
            "Sigh, nothing changes if nothing changes.",
            "Sad to hear about what happened with you. I applied for MS Construction Engineering and Management and got selected at the merit position of 6. The process was smooth, actually no hanki phanki.",
            "I enjoyed reading this 😭 (not in a bad way)",
            "I did not get any interview call only acceptance letter can anyone tell me what's going on?",
            "I’m currently in the MSCP program & yes, I’ve gone through exactly what you just went through last year. After a year in hell, all I can say to you is ke agar nahin bhi hota admission tou take it as some divine intervention to save you. The admin is very judgmental, hierarchies are pathetic, and the professors treat and insult you like toddlers. \n\nAnd yes. They will sell you this dream of top-notch hostels but as an MS student, you will NOT get them. I had a contact with someone higher up in admin last year and he specifically told me ke hum first year masters students ko hostels nahin detay. \n\nRegardless, they’re not going to tell you that. Apko hostel waitlist ki email ayegi AFTER classes have alr begun. And they won’t be attending your calls throughout this month. It’s pathetic.",

I expect more from women. I am a hardcore feminist, and in this context I want girls and women to talk about things that empower them, not what makes them attractive in male gaze. I thought, oh, things will be better at NUST. People will be smarter, more responsible about where they put their energies. Unfortunately, almost every girl I came across in my hostel engaged in exactly the same conversations as my college. Sexualizing themselves, constant crush talks, obbsession with gossips (which was basically just scrutinizing other people's love life.). I feel so incredibly lonely here. And I'm in no way taking a \"I'm not like other girls\" approach. I love female company. I just wish we'd collectively put our energies in a more worthy place. Talk about books, social problems. Things that matter. I feel sad when I see girls sexualizing themselves just to be likeable in eyes of men. It hurts me :/",

I'll be also getting into a university this September but while talking to one of my senior friends i came to know the same thing  , so it feels seriously bad when you have a high iq,  you have a dream and you are dedicated to it but the environment around you is filthy , remember it also shapes the way you think people may not believe this but its true , consequently you have to be a alone warrior once you've been through this stage i guess life is quite less difficult,  in my college i had no friends ,my own classmates didn't bother me , the few that did, had  a totally different destination,  that phase changed my whole personality and i was the topper of my class , people that mocked me were amazed , so we have to learn to fight alone .",

        "title": "“Good bye NUST Sub-Reddit . And Potentially Goodbye NUST . It was fun while it lasted………….” ~ With Love ",
        "body": "(Last Post) \n\nHello everyone . This is probably gonna be the first (for some) and last time you guys will hear from me in this sub . \n\nWell to start of , I unfortunately wasn’t able to cook enough . Honestly today was extremely hectic . Got my result today .  Found out my parents lost my HSSC certificate . Had to make a new one today . Had to pay 25K+ additional amount because apparently students who came from overseas have to pay in dollars 🫥\n\nAnyways , the important thing is , my result came back . I crossed the 120 mark finally . But unfortunately not the 130 mark . And thus my aggregate fell below 70%. While I was disappointed and depressed the entire day . Thankfully my parents were helpful . They said no problem “agar naseeb mai nahi Likha too nahi ho ga” . That kinda made feel better lol . \n\nOh well . It’s true I guess . Thankfully tho , I had planned backups universities (qualified as well for them) just in case this happened . While the other unis aren’t as good as NUST was especially to me . It’s better than nothing truthfully. \n\nI still remember the first day coming to this sub . Didn’t use Reddit much . This was my first sub that I joined and actually interacted with people . I have tbh met really nice people here . And they are literally one of the most helpful people I have ever seen . They helped me with Oetp books , MCQs that I didn’t understand . Gave me all the links and past papers and lectures links and what not . Helped me solve problems and more . For that I will always be great full to each and everyone one of them / you . \n\nEven if I didn’t get into the NUST uni , it doesn’t matter . I will still be greatfull . Call it copium 😭 or not . I actually had a lot of fun here . The panic , stress and anxiety and everything , the first time giving net , interacting with people on this sub, correcting them , getting worried over date sheets was all in a weird way a fun time . This will probably be the last time any of us will interact in subs like this with free time (other than studies) in our hands . After this year or even this year all of us will go our separate ways and continue in life . This time will never come again . So with that in mind , I am glad I was part of this sub and community while it lasted. \n\nI am actually gonna miss this and the fears and anxiety of giving net each time . Getting scared with everyone .Not knowing what’s to come . I do have my last entry test (that I will give for any uni) for FAST coming up so hopefully that atleast goes well . If that doesn’t work I have already been qualified (via passing the last years merit list) for admission for comsats , air , uet , PU , Bahria , IIUI , UST , etc (mostly cause of NTS) . So atleast that’s a bright side . \n\nTo end this on a less depressing note . I want to thank every single last one of you . Especially those who have helped me . And that I hope every single one of you who has given net and who will give net to succeed and get admission . Inshallah ALL of you (even those who don’t get in) will succeed in life . \n\nFor those who don’t get in like me . Don’t worry this isn’t the end of the world . Like my parnets said . If it isn’t meant to be it isn’t meant to be . \n\nSo to finish this off , I wish you all the best of luck and wishes and hope you all succeed in net and in life . It was nice knowing all of you !!\n\nGood bye guys !! \nGood bye NUST Sub !!\nAnd potentially goodbye NUST !! ❤️\n\n~Adios 🕊️",

So, to sum it up, it became harder for ICS and pre medical ones but easier for pre engineering ones. So, what is your opinion on how will the merit change. For me, it will at least remain near the same otherwise decrease. But I am no expert here so rumble up your opinions and grace upon this matter some light for me. ",

Meow overall if u ask me the only ones that should be affected by this are pre med peeps as they have to do maths now, which is obviously a really good thing. the ics peeps should now worry that much and instead should step up their physics game.",

        "body": "When I chose NUST, I chose it with hope... \n\nI was confident enough to convince my father, even though we both knew that without financial support, this journey would be difficult. I truly believed merit and hard work would eventually lead to a scholarship. When my name appeared on the merit list for my Master’s, honestly it felt like a dream coming true. But despite congratulating me my father’s first question was: “What about the scholarship?” At that time, I genuinely didn’t know. So I told him maybe the announcements hadn’t been made yet. A few days later, I came to know that students shortlisted for scholarships were already informed alongside the merit list. That realization was painful i kid you not, but I held on to hope. & I kept applying... semester after semester. Believing that maybe the next one would work out. \n\n**It didn't...**\n\nNow, as my third semester comes to an end and the fourth semester fee voucher arrives, I finally see the full cost of that hope. My father is now in debt of around 5 to 6 lakhs, still trying his best to support a dream he believed in because I believed in it. Today when he asked me to share the fee voucher so he could “see what he can do before the deadline,” it broke something inside me, because deep down i know what he has been going through. I already tried reaching out to the administration. I prayed... I asked... I explained... I honestly tried alot. But the only suggestion I got at the end was of a loan that too with long-term consequences & my father refused for that. \n\nAnd it’s not that I didn’t try, I did. I tried for many jobs, but I failed at that too.\n\nHonestly every night, I lie down with a mix of regret, guilt, and exhaustion wondering how can i be so mean to my family. I really wish that, at least once, I had considered the possibility of not receiving a scholarship. Maybe I would have stepped back from my dream, and perhaps things would have been easier. These thoughts are crushing me from the inside... \n\nI'm not blaming NUST... I’m not complaining about anything!  \nThis is just me admitting something difficult: I chose to chase my dream, and it cost my father his peace.\n\n**I honestly don't know what I'm upto with this post but its just that the guilt feels heavier than the degree!** ",

            "I'm not studying law or anything but you can actually sue them for the following\n• Refusing a tuition refund within 2 weeks of initiation (most educational institutions have this 1-2 week trail policy where the student gets a full refund provided the tuition service was unsatisfactory or some other circumstance). However this only applies if you really did request the refund within the first 2 weeks. You will not be entertained by any law if it was later than that.\n\n• If she really did make the ridiculous remark as you stated then you need to gather evidence for that. Hop on another online class and record your call (don't use the platform record feature) repeating your refund request again. If they give you the same reply, you now have good evidence of unprofessional support which will give you a slight upper hand but won't stand as a whole reason by itself to sue them.\n\nJust threaten them with this and they'll fold under pressure because not even the most powerful lawyer can fend against a civil rights article (That's if a Pakistani article of such nature exists) if not, then you can only pretend that you have the power to sue them (which works most of the time)\n\n• Final word of advice is to talk to the students that actually got in. Like there's a NUST discord server for prospective students to get free pdf books, past NETs and guidance from the students that got in (everything is free and open source). These teachers teach what they're told to teach and don't bother doing their own research to understand the \"NET RNG Subcategories\" which is basically a computer pattern randomizer that gives the questions based on the probability settings. Eg: 5% conic section, 40% calculus, 15% algebra etc. (these are not real probability settings since those are kept confidential). Point is that passionate teaching teachers are really scarce these days. Wouldn't you rather get guided by a person that is more than happy to give you that guidance for free just for the sake of helping you out? You'll find a lot of such people on that discord. I can attest their authenticity because me and my friend just joined that server 2 years ago for the giggles and managed to get in like a bunch of absolute dumbass goobers who spent no more than 2 days for the NET. He got in business with 150+.",

Since all you freshmen are witnessing what is happening rn with the OGs, look at it objectively and learn from it. Let me break it down:\n\n1) Please remember that your parents sent you here to dominate in your fields of study. Nobody will ever give a crap what you did in a stupid event once you go into the real world. \n\n2) Just because you interacted with a select part of the ON25 OC (the OGs) doesn't mean the people you didn't interact with are wrong. You've only heard the side of the people who are in direct contact with you. So hold your judgement. \n\n3) Tomorrow is the last orientation day. Lemme tell you that this is what happens in most events here at NUST. A bunch of dumb kids who can't look at anything objectively and just want drama. Please don't fall in this whole charade cuz all it does is affect your education and in the end you'll realise what really mattered was your CGPA, not these crybaby fests.",

            "Look, the thing is regardless of whether the orientation is 3 or 5 days, people will always find things to nitpick. The reason you're seeing very few socials is because NUST has a set number of concerts and other events every year, this year as far as I'm aware, multiple central events will be taking place and they will definitely have the funky socials you're looking for. Stop bashing kids in the organising committee who literally have nothing to do with the length of the orientation or the events allowed, this isn't highschool anymore and the number of events are limited and strictly micromanaged by Student Affairs, it is not just about funds anymore, it's about university policies. \n\n\nApart from that, if you don't want to come, then don't, you don't need to put down and discourage others from coming too. This event is a good opportunity for all freshies to interact with kids from other departments and also their seniors, believe it or not, those very OGs that you're shitting on, will be there to guide and help you settle in and if you have a friendly interaction, they'll even continue guiding you past the orientation days. Even if you don't decide to come, you won't miss out on much but at least act maturely and understand that not everything is going to happen your way. Literally every year, there are kids on here crying about shitty orientation experiences but there's also kids who have lots of fun, so honestly it's about how much you involve yourself in the event and just be free with your interactions.\n\n\nAlso word of advice, if you do end up coming and bring your parents along, do so early because the spacing for parents is limited as too many people come on the first day. \n\n\nLastly, just relax and enjoy the moment. Your goal is to make best of university life, not just a dumb 3 day orientation. Good luck! (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)",

There’s no fixed “easiest” test—prepare seriously for every attempt.\n\n----\n\nMerit Calculation: How Your Aggregate is Determined?\n\nNUST calculates your merit based on a weighted formula depending on your academic background.\n\nFor FSc (HSSC) Students:\n\n10% of Matric / SSC Marks\n\n15% of HSSC Part-1 Marks (or HSSC-1+HSSC-2 if result available)\n\n75% of NET Score\n\n\nFor O/A-Level Students:\n\n25% of O-Level Equivalency (issued by IBCC)\n\n75% of NET Score\n\n---\n\nMERIT TRENDS:\n\nYou can find one or two-year-old merit lists online to get an idea of the closing merits. A good rule of thumb is to add +2 to the last year’s closing merit to ensure a safer aggregate, as the merit tends to increase each year.\n\n----\n\nADDRESSING CONCERNS:\n\nPRE-MED STUDENTS: You must attempt the NET-Engineering (with Math) in order to be considered for admission into Engineering and Computing Programs.\n\nNUST also offers a condensed 8-week Inter Math Course for students who wish to take admission in these fields but are lacking in Math.\n\n\nA-LEVEL STUDENTS:\n\nPrepare for the full FSc syllabus for the NET.\n\nMath can be a shock for A-Level students as it’s much more comprehensive than the A-Level curriculum.\n\nCertain Physics topics such as Physical Optics and Modern Physics are not part of the A-Level syllabus, so make sure to cover those.\n\n\nEnglish: Generally, English isn’t an issue for A-Level students as the English section is easier for them.\n\n-----\n\nPREPARATION & COACHING TIPS:\n\nSelf-Study is Key:\n\nMany coaching centers exist in the twin cities and other parts of Pakistan, but self-study is always recommended.\nA student with strong concepts from HSSC won't struggle to get a decent score.\n\nFor A-Level students (based on personal experience):\n\nAn 8A student* can score 160+ with just 1 hour of daily study for 3–4 months.\n\nEven without much prep, a score around 125+ is realistic if you’ve got the basics down.\n\n----\n\nCOACHING OPTIONS:\n\nYouTube:\n\nMathflix by Hashim Zia (Math):\n\nOffers excellent free lectures on YouTube covering the entire FSc Math syllabus.\n\nHis teaching style is clear and entry-test focused.\n\nHe also has a paid coaching program (Rs. 7000 one-time) that includes:\n\n• Weekly assessments\n\n• Live classes\n\n• Personal support & doubt-solving\n\nPhysics is covered by Sir Hashim’s Brother.\n\nAlso available on YouTube for free, covering Physics topics relevant to NET.\n\nIdeal for students who prefer conceptual clarity without coaching costs.\n\nNustrive – Offers coaching and study groups via WhatsApp.\n\nFee: Rs. 25,000/- one-time.\n\nWell-reviewed, but pricier.\n\n\nKIPS Academy:\n\nOffers both in-person and online NET preparation.\n\nReviews are mixed; Flagship branch in Saddar, Rawalpindi is considered better if you're going the KIPS route.\n\n-------\n\nRecommended Preparation Books (For Self-Study):\n\nThere are plenty of practice books available in the market, but not all of them are worth your time. Here are the ones that actually help:\n\n1. KIPS FUNG Series (Highly Recommended):\n\nKnown to be the toughest practice material available.\n\nGreat for building speed, accuracy, and exam stamina.\n\nHelps students understand deep conceptual questions, not just surface-level MCQs.\n\n2. OETP – NET Engineering (Especially for English):\n\nThis is your go-to resource for the English section.\n\nPhysics is also good, but basic math is explained in this book and the entrance test tends to be rough if you prepare maths from this source.\n\n\n\nFinal Note:\n\nThanks to everyone who made it this far!\n\nThe purpose of this megathread is to centralize all NET-related queries, tips, and discussions in one place and help reduce spam or repeated questions across the subreddit. Whether you're asking for help or sharing your own experience, your contribution will help future applicants too.\n\nBest of luck to everyone preparing for NET – may you all get your dream programs and campuses!\nLet’s help each other out and make this thread a valuable resource for all.",

        "title": "[NET NBS] Gave NET today, here's what came (Tips + Topics)",
        "body": "(I don't know how it got deleted but here you go again)\n\nHey everyone! I just gave my **NET for NBS today**, and since I know a lot of people have questions (I did too before the test), I wanted to share what I remember and some tips that might help. Firstly I will say that the math portion was **not** that difficult. I was very worried but it turned out to be pretty decent with a few repeating topics.\n\n\\-The thing that came the most was **Factorization**. For example: They'll give you `6x²+11x−35` and ask you to factorize it. You just have to choose the correct option from the MCQs. (I would recommend backsolving, if the quadratic is too complex. Just be quick with it)  \n\\-Then there was **Simulatenous Equations**. Again very easy. Two linear equations, you solve for `x` and `y` , use substitution method. (In some questions, elimination was faster)  \n\\-A little bit of **Matrices**. For example multiplication of matrices or asking you the order of a matrix. (Order is row x column)  \n\\-You **MUST** do **Permutation, Combination** and **Probability**. It's super important. I would recommend watching this entire playlist from this guy: [Permutation, Combination and Probability](https://youtu.be/VsTmVRezVSk?si=6NLO5E8NKEoPVTrX) Many **word problems** from these topics appeared. And the word problems are the questions mentioned in the video, so you have to watch it.  \n\\- I watched a youtube video from **Hashim Zia** where he solves the **past paper** of NBS, and a couple of MCQs came from that video. Although the video was poorly made (and not explained in the best way), I would still say to watch that video because it'll save you time in the exam. When those exact same MCQs came, I didn't even need to solve. I just selected the answer I remembered and moved on. Watch that video for recognition and understanding what type of questions appear. If something confuses you, just use ChatGPT to understand it better but **MUST** watch that video. I'll link it: [Hashim Zia: NBS Past paper solution](https://youtu.be/gS85IlYIPMk?si=43GA2AZO6pKAB0gK)  \n\\-**Area of square, shaded area** and etc. Do that. There was a question where a square was drawn, and then the midpoints of the square were connected in a diamond shape inside it. They then asked the area of that diamond shape.  \n\\-You obviously need to learn the **sin, cos, and tan table**. Multiple questions required those.  \n\\- **Algebra**: There were like 2-3 MCQs like \"`x = √5 - 3`, then find `x - (1/x)`\" This is super easy and doable. Free marks.  \n\\-**Line of symmetry** came (But I think only 1 question) I didn't know this one so I would say do check it out. Maybe in next NET, there will be in more MCQs from this topic.  \n\\-**Percentage**. This came *A LOT*. You really need to get a clear concept of percentages. Like **discount, profit, loss** and etc. Another question was like \"`If there are 100 bacterias originally and after every 2 hours bacterias double and every 4 hours, 25% of them are eliminated. How many bacterias will be there after 10 hours?`\"  \n\\-There were questions related to **rotation/geometry** like \"`If a triangle has all vertices in Quadrant 3 after 270 degree rotation, where was it originally`\" (Ans: Quadrant 4)  \n\\-Also questions about **Average**. This is as important as permutation, combination and probability. It's easy though. For example: \"`The average price of 200 houses is 400000, but if a house whose cost was 20000 is destroyed. What is the average of the other houses`\"  \nYou're gonna solve it like **Average = (Sum)/(Number)**  \n`400000=(Sum)/200`  \n`Sum=80000000`  \n`Then you'll minus the cost of that destroyed house`  \n`New sum = 79980000`  \n`Now new average is 79980000/199`  \n`Average = 401909.5`  \nSo it's pretty simple, you just need to get this concept. There were multiple questions like this.\n\nAnyways, that's all I remember! I hope this helped whoever needed this. Best of luck guys!!\n\nEdit: I'll keep adding stuff that I remember, so follow the post so you can get notif (right?) when I post a comment. Or just manually keep checking. BUT DO CHECK.

            "ALSO  \n\\-**Series and Sequence:** This came a lot as well. **MUST** do this. Especially arithmetic mean and it's sum. It wouldn't be too tough tho because even if you don't know how to calculate sum by formula, you can do it manually (if the series is easy) For example one question was: \"Sum of the first 6 sequences: 7,14,21,28,...\" Obviously you can tell this is the table of 7 so you can guess the next sequence. Another one was smartly disguised. It was like  \n`√7, √28, √63, ... What's the next one?`   \nLooks tough, right? But it's really not. Solve the square root for √28 and √63, you'll get 2√7 and 3√7 respectively. So now you can see the pattern.   \n√7, 2√7, 3√7, ...? (Ans: 4√7) But the option wasn't this. The option was √112 (which is equal to 4√7)   \nSo definitely do this!",

        "body": "Alright, here’s the whole thing in Fortnite terms:\n\nOGs set up the map and loot spawns so freshmen (new players) have a smooth first match. \n\nFor a whole month, players kept reporting this “Socials guy” (around 20 reports = 20 spammed report buttons), but the admins (EC) never hit him with the ban hammer.\n\nOn Day 1 of the big drop (Orientation), instead of playing fair, this guy started smoking in the safe zone and emoting PDA in front of 3,000 freshmen. Basically, he was griefing the entire lobby.\n\nWhen people complained, the admins sided with him just because he paid for 6 ON-fest stalls (He bought V-Bucks, so Epic won’t ban him).\n\nOGs who stood up got threatened and told to uninstall (resign) if they didn’t like the decision.\n\nEventually, OGs rage quit (resigned) because their mission was to protect freshmen, not watch the game get pay-to-win corrupted.\n\nEven after leaving, the OGs kept helping freshmen in DMs, guiding them around the “map” (Nust campus), proving they didn’t actually abandon their squad.\n\n\nTLDR in Fortnite terms: The OGs were legit squad leaders who cared about the noobs’ first match. EC let a toxic pay-to-win griefer ruin the lobby, so the OGs dipped, but they’re still coaching the noobs off-match.\n\nP.S not completely on any one particular side in this matter (couldn't care less what sophomores have to fight over). This is from someone else's reddit post on the matter put in chat gpt to make it into Fortnite terms. Had to add this in for that one dude who got brain damage from \"gawk gawking\" too hard",

And for those still waiting on the next merit list, I really hope your name shows up soon 🤞\n\nBut here’s the part I really want to highlight. NUST offers so many activities outside of classes: bowling, hiking, horse riding, swimming, gym, all of it. Even if you’re not living in the hostel, these things can keep you occupied and help you grow.\n\nOut of all these, **I strongly recommend two things: horse riding and swimming. Both are lifelong skills**. Swimming can literally save lives, keeps you fit, and is a great stress-buster. Horse riding builds confidence, balance, and honestly, it’s just an amazing experience you won’t easily get elsewhere.\n\nThe best part? At NUST, these activities are available at the cheapest rates possible for students. So don’t miss out. \n\nThat’s all from my side. Wishing everyone the best for their uni journey.",

Ignored them and continued studying UNTIL one of the guys from the group came up to me randomly and asked if he could sit with me. I was firstly confused like huh uhh the whole place is empty sit wherever you want but he insisted he wanted to sit next to me on that tiny bench and I didn't know what to do so I said ok but I was visibly uncomfortable and backed off to the side as much as I could. I asked him koi dare Mili hai Kya? because that's the only explanation, he said no he just wanted to get to know me??(Probably still was a dare ig cuz ain't no way) I was like ok but I ignored him because I was very uncomfortable and just started using my phone waiting for him to leave. He didn't and asked me random questions, I replied minimally to all of them but then he asked me ke ap akele kyun bethi hain Yahan ap ka koi dost nahi hai?? Like bruh why do u care and that's so creepy 😭😭??

I sent them a polite voice note saying that I believe that they uphold transparency, so please clarify whatever has happened here, like I did say that maybe it was my fault. Then I received a call from Sir Bilal Zia. He basically shouts at me. I told him that I was polite in the voice note and just wanted clarification. He literally said, \"Agar mein tumhein politely maa behn ki galiyan don phir?\" I remained calm and respectful throughout the call, but he wasn't having it. He kept on insisting me to tell him my FSc marks, which I didn't. Then he said I'm gonna remove you from the batch and ended the call by saying, \"Ye ra*di ke bache.\" Then he removed me from the batch without ever giving me an answer. I do have the call recording for proof. Some of friends insisted that I expose him by publishing the recording online, but I don't know, it might create more problems for me.

I just focused on my FSC and ended up taking a gap year because I was confused about whether to choose a local university in my city or attend a good university.\n\n\n\nNow, seeing the fees for NUST and hearing from others that they aren’t getting scholarships has been discouraging.

Even today I think about \"kash LUMS chala jata\" (even though I could never affoard it) because grass is greener on the other side, always.\n\nDon't break your financial barrier for NUST.

Where as UET the semester fees (i did 2nd year now and just got into uet and willl start going in this September) is about 70k per semester plus if you are orphan or ur income is like less than 60k per month you get financial scholarships here by default (note you have to pay 53k admission fee here nomatter what). Also ppl of UET get a lot of scholarships. Nearly about 30pc ppl have honhar scholarship and considering ur matric score (mine 92.6% lhr board) you have a great chance at getting it. Ppl may say bad about it compare to nust but you have to see something uni are nothing in job market accept a tag that get you across the first screening.

        "body": "\nListen up you all\nThere are two types of documents submission\n1. Till 11th august for peeps who got selected in first list, you can send these docs via tcs or you can go to the institute.\n\n-What do you need?\n1. Nust Paid invoice copy (no need to attest this)\n2. SSC (matric) marksheet\n3. SSC (matric) certificate \n4. HSC-1 (first year) marksheet\n[in case of gap year students——-> FSc Marksheet and Certificate, you wont need fsc-1, just your whole FSc]\n5. Copy of your father/guardian CNIC\n6. Copy of your CNIC, or form-B in case you don’t have your CNIC yet.\n7. If youre a pre med and took that condensed maths course, you need to send the certificate of it and need minimum of 60%.\n\n\nNow all of these things should be PHOTOCOPIES, NOT ORIGINAL, i repeat PHOTOCOPIES, attested by any government officer of 17+ grade. (Except the fee invoice, don’t get it attested)\nYou zip it all up and send it via tcs or go in by yourself (your choice).\nAddress of NUST to send documents: \n\n\nUndergraduate Registration Section, Main Office, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Sector H-12, Islamabad\n\n\n2. Documents of the day you will join university, aka orientation day.\n\n1. SSC marksheet attested by IBCC (original)\n2. SSC certificates attested by IBCC (original)\n3. HSC-1 marksheet attested by IBCC (original)\n[If you’re on a gap year, you will need to get both of your HSC marksheet and certificate attested by IBCC (original)]\n4. Photocopy of CNIC or form-B of yourself attested by 17+ grade officer \n5. Photocopy of CNIC of your father/guardian attested by 17+ grade officer \n6. Attested by 17+ grade officer photocopy of Domicile\n7. Passport sized photographs (your school of your department will guide you more about it)\n8. Medical fitness certificate (you can download it from where you’ll get the invoice and can fill it out from any doc of gov sector)\n9. Affidavit (will be issued by your school)\n\n\nI HOPE THIS CLEARS OUT EVERY THING I TRIED MY BEST TO MAKE IT SIMPLE AS MUCH AS I CAN\n\nYOU CAN ASK MORE IF NEEDED OR CAN DM ME AS WELL\n\nEdit—-> Since majority of you do not possess matriculation certificate. It’s okay if you don’t have it, your board will issue it after 3 years. ITS OKAY IF YOU DONT HAVE IT.\n\n\nREGARDING IBCC:\n\n[information regarding IBCC Attestation](https://ibcc.edu.pk/attestation-application-process/)\n\nOriginal document is 1200 per and\nCopy of document is 600 per\n—> would advise you to only send original.\n\n—> I have personally emailed NUST and asked them which documents we need to get attested by IBCC. They told me to:\n\n-SSC/matric: [either marksheet aka DMC OR (یا پھر ) Certificate]\n\n-HSC/inter: [either marksheet aka DMC OR (یا پھر ) Certificate]\n\n—> Case 01: Most of you do not have your SSC certificate, so only get your marksheet attested by IBCC.\n\n{When HSC-II results will be announced, you will get that marksheet attested later by IBCC and then submit it to NUST}\n\n\n—-> Case 02: You have both your SSC marksheet and Certificate, get your certificate attested by IBCC.\n\n\n—-> Case 03: You’re on a gap year and have SSC marksheet and HSC marksheet, attest both of them.\n\nMAIN THING IS TO GET ATTESTED ANY ONE OF YOUR DOCUMENT FROM BOTH INTER AND MATRIC.\nIF YOU HAVE BOTH MARKSHEET AND CERTIFICATE, PRIORITISE YOUR CERTIFICATE.\n\n[Check out this article as well](https://nustuga-admissions-queries.blogspot.com/2025/08/documents-to-handover-to-nust-h-12-for.html?m=1)\n\n\nJazakAllah.",

Pulled me into a frnd group that was like… the insecure emo gossip pipeline™. Alll they did was judge ppl n trauma dump for clout. And let’s talk abt SEEECS (yea, calling it out): toxic af. Everyone is in competition mode 24/7, no one supports each other, n we’re all pretending like oh we’re fine when we’re absolutely *not*.\n\nLike let’s be fr for a sec: **SEEECS is so toxic that EVERYONE is struggling they just won’t admit it.** We’re all lowkey drowning and still showing up like “haha i’m so chill” when our nervous systems are fried. this whole performative calm thing is insanee. We NEED to stop acting like it’s just a \"you\" problem. It’s not. It’s the system. FUCK\n\nSome profs show clear favoritism, act like they’re better than us, and lowkey humiliate students, n still?? NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT. When I *did* speak up, I got hit with “that’s a YOU problem.” Nah bro, it’s an *everyone* problem, you’re just scared to admit it.\n\ni've met more fake, two-faced, petty ppl than i ever thought possible. The only decent folks i met were in my hostel, n guess what? Not even in my department lmao.\n\nAnd the weirdest part? People get so insecure abt my english. Like they’ll *litr* correct tiny grammar things in convo js to feel better about themselves, while butchering the language themselves 💀 Like bro, the point of language is communication, not flexing ur fake superiority complex. In the country I grew up in, no one did that, as long as you were making sense, ppl respected you. This country is OBSESSED with putting others down. STUPIDEST THING. \n\nI’m so tired. I’m not gonna lie, this year broke smth in me. But i’m also hopeful. next year I’m joining societies, meeting new ppl, and finding MY crowd. Because this version of uni? Nah. I’m not letting it be my whole story.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt like this, hmu. Let's be delulu besties, lift each other up, and actually talk about the real stuff.",

            "I don’t usually comment on posts, but what made me understand your experience completely (even though I’m not in SEECS) is one thing. My high school colleague goes there, and let me tell you the toxicity from that one person is insane. End level competition for no reason, lack of empathy and back stabbing nature. Thankfully my fields were always different so we never became too close. What I’d suggest is, don’t compare your high school social life to this department. You don’t NEED THEM. Seriously! Treat people as colleagues (makes life so much easier when you don’t put labels of friendships). Realise that these 4 years are your work/ job where you survive during the classes with these toxic ass people. For fun and stuff, go to other departments NBS etc and clubs where you vibe with people or even your hostel friends. A lot of kids on this forum are dying to get into SEECS as far as I’ve noticed. You did amazing and got in.

        "title": "This is all abt nust Girls Hostels!!",
        "body": "Okay so lil ones i know you guys must have watched all those videos or read all the information on the internet available abt the hostel so this post is for those curious beings who will not stop searching for more so go ahead and read this long ahh post: \n• There are 5 hostels for girls Amna, Khadija, Ayesha, Zainab and Fatima (for PG students). Talking abt all the hostels and the confusion regarding the cupboards and stuff so lemme clarify this for u Amina hostel has the best rooms and it also has like double door cupboards i mean like proper ones for each roommate (3 ofc). Khadija hostel has single door cupboards which means less space as compared to Amna hostel rooms but it is manageable. To all the unlucky ppl who'll get Ayesha hostel i am sorry to tell you this but the unlucky victim to arrive at the end will have to get a shelf like a book rack or something really small with the corner side bed well it is your thing to sort this problem of space out with your roommates. Zainab Hostel I don't know abt but i think there are cupboards for all three of the roommates. \n• Washrooms - My dear aspirants this is the worst part abt being a hostelite. All four UG hostels have community bathrooms and guess what they are worse. On one side u get the toilets and on the other side u get the shower stalls. The toilet part is worse then ever sometimes since it gets cleaned once in a day and the shower stalls are also in bad condition like there are no hooks in some or in some you don't have space to keep your shower essentials. So to tackle with this i would suggest you to bring a shower basket or maybe something to carry your shower essentials in it. Do bring handwash, soap all essentials with you. Get your pair of towels, hangers ( i bought 4 or 5 cuz i thought i do not need these many but i would say u need more cuz i had to buy more too), dishwashing liquid/bar whatever, few dishes, cup or cups, spoon, fork ( well depends on you how many i have lil more than my roommates cuz i don't like eating in disposable boxes), snacks as many as you want cuz mess food... let's talk abt that later, tissue ppr, lil baskets to keep your stuff in (optional but recommended). Also I would like to add something to this detail the sink you wash dishes in is inside the washroom YES!! it is inside the washroom do all the disgusting faces but you'll get used to it and if not used to it then you'll get to cope with it.\n• Ohhh yess!! Laundry so guys there is laundry room on the ground floor and you can get your clothes washed (weekly basis free) and ironed ( one piece per day free) incase you want to get your laundry urgently done (next day you get it back)  you'll have to pay I don't know how much per piece costs but to save up that money you can bring your own detergent, balti or tub whatever (it's no shame guys bring it with you or you'll have to beg your frnds for it like i do i am still not bringing mine).\n• Shops in nust - so u get more things then you expect from the marts -from a hair pin to all the stationary to good snacks. They have printing shops, mobile shops, stationary shop, juice corners, cafes (quite many) and almost everything you need is here. \n• Mess - okay so no you cannot get your mess off cuz you don't wanna eat mess food it's like you have to pay for it no matter you eat twice, once or not at all. They don't care abt that. Abt the mess food well as being a person from a city where food is what it's all abt i do not like mess food. I won't say it's not good for everyday or every meal, it is good sometimes but after the menu change this year it ain't that good as it was before. Also I don't want to sound ungrateful but mess food doesn't excite my taste buds and there ain't any mutton in mess so you either spend dollars here to get mutton related food or you go home and have it after centuries. There ain't any open kitchen for students to cook that's not allowed but you can keep your food that you got from home in freezer they have in mess for students.\n• More abt Room - well my lil munchkins promise yourselves that you won't let your roommates cross your boundaries and keep healthy boundaries and ties with one another well I won't say i got good roommates but better then most. Three beds - corner bed ( i think of it better and it's most desirable), two side by side one with the window and the other one beside the cupboards (worst one). Well there are two windows which obviously reside by the corner bed and the wall side bed. I got used to the worst one but plssssss get to your hostel as soon as possible and take over that corner bed it saves you from a lot. I am introvert so that bed was my dream. There is one mirror in the room and so if you are a introvert like me you'll just sit there either get late for your class or get to your class without your makeup done or homeless some days but that's my choice. Three lights but guess what no each light is not for each roommate unfortunately the one who forms the dominance will get to control the lights or you just prioritize your boundaries and get to do what u want. Well if u have the dream bed then go ahead that light above your bed is yours to control. There are two study tables and those are to be shared nobody owns that no matter you come first or last. \nCleaning - you write in the register in the office that u need your room to get cleaned and it gets cleaned the next day (sometimes late). I would suggest you to bring stuff like a broom to clean the room ppl here have that obviously if u care abt the cleanliness you'll bring one and the other thing is a tiny dustbin or you can use one of the hostels at the end of each wing.\nClothes/shoes/other stuff - don't go for bringing the fancy clothes like okay get one or two or three maybe but more than that is a mess cuz u get to wear them rarely also do not bring heels cuz u get to walk here allatttt. There are shuttles but believe me the day u need them the most you'll not get them so better not rely on them. Baki bring whatever girly stuff u want to get. Bring an umbrella for God sake it's so hot out here you'll burn yourself also as a hostelite you get to walk to your respective depts and if it's raining or this much heat outside obvio you are gonna die without an umbrella. \nHomesickness - well well well that's gonna happen and if you feel homesick we all do and if you don't feel homesick in the beginning get yourself buckled up for the worse rollercoaster of emotions because you are gonna hate hostel once you feel homesick either after a month, three months or 4. You don't get used to it like u think you'll. But if u get to make good frnds you are going to enjoy a lot hangouts and stuff and you get to help each other cheer up when you are down. So nothing to feel worried abt.\nI hope i didn't miss something important. This is all.\n\n",

            "TL;DR\n\n\n1. Girls Hostels at NUST\n\nThere are 5 hostels for girls:\n\nAmna\n\nKhadija\n\nAyesha\n\nZainab\n\nFatima (for postgraduate students)\n\n\nRoom & Cupboard Situation:\n\nAmna Hostel: Best rooms. Each girl (in a triple-sharing room) gets a double-door cupboard.\n\nKhadija Hostel: Single-door cupboards, so less space but manageable.\n\nAyesha Hostel: The last girl to arrive gets stuck with a tiny shelf (like a bookrack) near the corner bed. Space issues—so talk it out with your roommates.\n\nZainab Hostel: Probably has cupboards for all three roommates, but not confirmed.\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Washrooms\n\nHere’s the harsh truth: All 4 undergrad hostels have community bathrooms.\n\nToilets on one side, shower stalls on the other.\n\nToilets may get gross (cleaned once a day).\n\nShower stalls often lack hooks or space for essentials.\n\n\nTips:\n\nBring a shower basket or tote.\n\nEssentials to pack:\n\nHandwash, soap, towels\n\nHangers (you’ll need more than you think)\n\nDishwashing soap/bar\n\nA few dishes, a cup or two, fork/spoon\n\nLots of snacks (mess food isn’t it!)\n\nTissue paper, baskets (for organizing)\n\nNOTE: The dishwashing sink is inside the washroom—yup, gross, but you’ll deal.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Laundry\n\nFree laundry once a week.\n\nFree ironing of one item per day.\n\nUrgent laundry? You pay extra (not sure how much).\n\nTip: Bring your own detergent, bucket, or tub (yes, really).\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Shops on Campus\n\nYou’ll find:\n\nStationery shops\n\nPrinting/copy shops\n\nMobile accessories\n\nCafés, juice corners, snacks\n\nBasically, you’ll find most of what you need inside campus.\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Mess Food\n\nYou must pay for the mess, whether you eat or not.\n\nQuality? Meh. Sometimes good, mostly bland.\n\nNo mutton, ever. No open kitchens either.\n\nYou can store home food in the mess freezer though.\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Inside the Room\n\n3 beds:\n\nCorner bed – best, near windows\n\nWindow bed – second best\n\nCupboard-side bed – worst (sorry)\n\n\n\nTips:\n\nArrive early to grab the corner bed!\n\nOnly 1 mirror in the room.\n\nLighting drama – 3 lights, not individually assigned. Be clear about boundaries.\n\n2 study tables shared between 3 girls.\n\nRoom cleaning: Write in the register, it gets cleaned next day (or later).\n\nBring your own broom and small dustbin.\n\n\n\n---\n\n7. What to Pack (Besides Essentials)\n\n1–3 fancy outfits max. You won’t wear more.\n\nNo heels! Too much walking.\n\nUmbrella – it gets super hot and it rains too.\n\nYour favorite girly stuff—go ahead!\n\n\n\n---\n\n8. Homesickness is Real\n\nYou will feel homesick—maybe after 1 month, 3 months, or more. It hits eventually.\nBut if you find good friends, the fun, support, and hangouts make hostel life much better.\n\n\n---\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is everything I could think of. Hope it helps you prepare and feel less nervous. You've got this!\n\n\n---",

        "body": "In 2024, I joined one of the most hyped online NET preparation academies. It’s run by an egoistic CEO ,Many of you will instantly recognize the platform, it’s branded around “nusture” students for top university admissions.\nWhat most people don’t see is the dark side. Girls from my batch were called into one-on-one Zoom meetings late at night. Some students were verbally abused and humiliated in class. The atmosphere was far from professional, and many of us felt uncomfortable and powerless at the time.\nBack then I thought: what difference would it make if I spoke up? But staying silent only protects people who misuse their position of authority.\nI do not want to post his name directly due to many reasons, but those who have been part of this academy will know exactly who I am talking about.\nI’m sharing this because I know there are other students who went through the same academy. Have you had similar experiences? And how can we make sure students are protected from this kind of misconduct in the future?\n\nStudents preparing for their future deserve respect, not exploitation.",

            "Firstly, the guy that runs instagram of nustrive and tells us about the MP etc is not the ceo. CEO is nowsherwan khan and he’s looking into other stuff; he’s very active on WhatsApp and replies to almost everyone. I agree w the point that the guy who runs instagram and tells us abt the inside info is unarguably rude and sounds a bit immature sometimes but the only issue is that his predictions are most of the times correct. We can raise questions on his behaviour but not his work. Secondly, a lot of my female friends joined nustrive and did well in their net and were totally comfortable with the environment. There are two sirs one is Nowsherwan and the other is Safeer, they both are always guiding students very actively on WhatsApp and mahol light karne ke liye mazak kar lete hain.

No hesitation. No shame. Just walks off like it’s Monday morning, totally normal. Confidence level: pro-level 🙂\n Food might seem small, lekin yeh behavior? It speaks volumes about a person.\nI’m not posting for drama, seriously. But let me tell you ... watching someone casually cross lines like all this is entertaining + horrifying at the same time.

Please let me know if you have any other sort of information regarding this hostel thing, that can be helpful. Thank you all🫶🏻",

            "If you perform well in NET and get in the first merit list your internal hostel is secured it has a triple occupancy but based on luck or genuine issues like medical etc biseater and single can be alloted \nYou pay twice a year for hostel and mess bill monthly i guess 620 per day for three meals its v much better than external hostels because saves travel cost bills etc and food especially plus uou get to engage in an environment make friends and focus on study more because seniors and class fellows help curfew timings and drug policy is strict"

        "title": "A snake Friendship ??",
        "body": "I had a close friend in my first semester. We were like best friends—we shared everything, joked around, and overall had a great bond. During that semester, he developed a crush on one of our classmates, who was also part of our group for a specific project. Despite that, everything remained normal between us. By the end of the first semester, we even thanked each other for the support we gave throughout, and things ended on a positive note.\nIn the second semester, however, things started to feel different. He became overly focused on her. As a friend, I genuinely wanted him to succeed and hoped things would work out for him, even though his feelings were one-sided at the time. In an attempt to get closer to her, he slowly distanced himself from me. He joined different groups in two courses just to spend more time with her.\nBecause of this, I was mostly on my own and eventually mingled with other friends. His behavior toward me changed noticeably, but I tried to be understanding and didn’t make an issue out of it. Later, I came to realize that the girl was manipulative and was using him for her academic benefit and social status. When I tried to warn him initially, he reacted very negatively and even insulted me at times. Eventually, he discovered the truth himself and came back to us.\n              At that point, our main friend group consisted of four people—me, him, and the two friends I had bonded with while I was alone. The semester ended well, and I genuinely believed things were back on track.\nDuring the summer break, he helped me by attending Zoom classes with me and supported me in clearing my courses with good grades. For that, I was truly grateful.\nIn the third semester, things were generally okay, but I started noticing a change in his attitude. He seemed more arrogant and distant, especially after achieving academic success. He became more attached to one of the two friends I had previously bonded with, and I began to feel sidelined again. Still, I ignored it.\nAfter the midterm exams, he ranked among the top three students in our class. I was genuinely happy for him. However, his attitude worsened significantly. I eventually confronted him about it, but he was no longer the person he was in the first semester.\n               A few days ago, I was already frustrated and ended up having a short but rude exchange with him (about 5–10 messages). I later apologized, accepting that I initiated the argument. Despite this, the following Monday he completely ignored me, as if I didn’t exist, and spoke to mutual friends as though the issue was unresolved—even though we had settled it in chat.\nThe next day, while he didn’t ignore me, he behaved harshly and disrespectfully, making me feel insignificant. This was extremely hurtful, and I never expected this kind of behavior from him.\nAfter sharing all of this, I would genuinely appreciate advice on what I should do next.\nThank you for your patience and for taking the time to read this.",

Can't make a complete judgement. If he's a thetha, you need to be a thetha in order to stay in the same circles unfortunately. \n\nCause someone studying hard feels the need to associate with people who can carry their own weight in academics, who don't bring his group's gpa down too much just cause one or some of them don't chip in as hard as they are chipping in. \n\nFind people who you naturally are at ease with in this semester. And try to stick with them."

        "body": "I’m currently studying at nust mce Risalpur, however I’m not really happy with the environment there because there is no social life there, no events, no muns and we didn’t even get welcome party. Seniors there have an attitude and you are supposed to greet them and there they will be called sir (no bhai). So because of this you can not generally take guidance from seniors and it is a problem because I need seniors to guide me and to talk to them openly about the academics and about building portfolio. I feel like there is no exposure in mce as well because I have been to main campus on many occasions and the difference is quite large between the two campuses. I have heard about mce degree that it is not as valuable as the degree of main campus. I feel hopeless there about life and the way things are there, it isn’t really a good match for me. 3-4 days back I had to take all my belongings(emptied hostel), give clearance and came back to my house due to some issues. I haven’t withdrawn from mce yet but I was considering doing so and take a gap year to prepare for next net and go to main campus. Is it a good decision? because one thing to consider is academically I’m not going good at mce the whole environment and my mental state there dragged my performance down by a significant amount. If you have read it till here, Thank you so much and it is really appreciated.",

I shared a tri-seater room with one of my friends and another roommate I didn’t know at all. She was in her thesis phase, while my friend and I had regular classes, mine in the morning and hers in the evening. \nEvery morning around 9, I had to get ready, which meant opening the cupboard, going to the bathroom, and quietly using my things. I was always extremely careful and conscious that both of them were asleep, yet she would still get annoyed, questioning why I opened the cupboard repeatedly...😒\n\nIronically, when she came back late at night, it was a completely different story. I would already be asleep, and she’d enter noisily, throw her bag on the bed, open the cupboard without a second thought, and slam the door shut while leaving, the sound echoing in my ears and jolting me awake. Not only that, she would often have long phone calls late at night. Even though she tried to keep her voice low, her constant whispering and murmuring were extremely irritating, especially during my exam period, when my anxiety was already at its peak. Despite how disturbed and overwhelmed I felt, I never said a single word to her about it. Long story short, she never showed the same consideration she expected from me!🙂\n\nOn top of that, she would taunt me, saying things like I had a shrill voice or that I lacked manners & much more, even though I’m just a friendly person who tried her best to be mindful especially around her. Those comments hurt deeply, and there were moments when it all became so overwhelming that it brought me to tears!🤧",

I stayed in external hostel for a year and i have a friend from karachi he had a waiting number of more than 500.\n\nSo what happens is when the final year batch graduates, they first allot all the students on the waiting list and then the incoming batch. But every year, the batch size and number of hostelites increases hence, not everyone gets accomdation. Now (2025 batch) almost the entire batch didn't get accommodation inside nust (boys). Meaning next year when the waiting list students are alloted internal hostel (2025 batch waitlist students alloted in 2026) , there may not be any rooms available to allot to the new batch. \n\nSo the number of students on the waiting list increases every year and there is a chance that even after living in external hostel for the first year, if you are at the bottom part of the waiting list, you may not be alloted hostel"

            "I'd assume you're talking about a level math, and while mechanics is great I always hated it, even statistics 2 is better than that in terms of ease, if we're talking degree wise, while you use the statistics 2 concepts more generally, and theh removed mechanics from applied physics in EE, Id still say go for mechanics cuz it builds your understanding very well and also helps in physics.\nThe program itself is great, our section got really really good teachers and I've liked the faculty quite a lot overall, good teachers who know what they're teaching. The timetable however is HORRENDOUS, AND I MEAN JUST TERRIBLE. But don't let that demotivate you because it's also fun at the same time. EE is a great program I'd personally recommend it",

He asked me to get out and took my solution and said you're getting zero straightaway phr kya meine maaafi taalafi ki but no rehm wo karam. He evaluated everyone one by one mein waha beth kr tamasha dekhun aur he is asking me ki bhaii tm kuin bethe ho you may leave lekin mein wahan betha rha until he evalueted everyone except me. At the end we did the appology session again and this time my culprit friend joined me and the happy ending ki sir finally agreed to evaluate yet the Keela khori was at topp. \n\n**Petition to ban Keela Khoorii in NUST**",

            "A genuinely dumb reply. \n\n Prof told OP not to speak until evaluation is over after the first incident. First time, it wasn't his fault but the next instance, he chose to reply to his fellow. That's on him. These professors have to deal with these shenanigans for hours on end and there's a blurry line between actually cheating and just being stupid. So they don't have time to differentiate between the two. Now yes, the prof didn't kicked out the other student so it's kinda unfortunate op got grinded but it wouldn't have happened if op didn't reply.\n\nSecondly. Naming and shaming? What will that accomplish? Nothing. These professors don't give a flying frick what their reputation is among the students. So just \"woohoo shame shame\" us just a childish harkat to make yourself feel good.\n\nTo OP. Dost dost hoty hain. Classmates classmates hoty hain. Yes, help them and be kind. But not when it's hurting you and it's for a wrong cause such as cheating. Exam halls me to bus chup karky kaam kiya karo. Kisi ki mat suna karo. Sure, you'll get shunned but it will develop respect too that you're not be messed with."

Ye time change hota rehta hai from time to time depend on SI, OC, or Company Commanders mood. Exams week mien mein raat 2 bajay tak allow kardetay hain.\n\nBtw ye cheezien boys hostel kay lye hain. Girls hostel (from what I have heard) is shit. Suna hai unka khana bhi acha nahi hai. Aik chota sa ghar type sa hai with very restricted freedom. So if any girl as joining, Allah bhala karay apka or apnay hifz o aman mien rakhay.",

Also, ACCA is a professional certification, and I’d still need a degree if I want to apply for a work visa later. I know about the University of London degree option with ACCA, but it’s too expensive, and I have other reasons for not choosing it.\nSo my main question is: Does a BSAF degree from NUST have value? Will I be able to get a job after graduating?\nI’m also planning to do ACCA after my degree since I’ll get exemptions. Alternatively, I could go for CFA, CMA, etc. I know that in the business field, LUMS and IBA have the strongest reputation, but their fees are very high, so they’re not an option for me. As for financial aid, I don’t expect much (maybe 10–20%) since my father’s salary is decent and he can afford the fees.\nI’d really appreciate honest advice from NUST grads, BSAF students, or anyone working in finance/accounting.\nIs BSAF from NUST worth it? Will it help me land a decent job or at least a job?\nThanks in advance!",

It's the best university in Pakistan imo, has a big beautiful campus, strong professors with networks if you want a master's or PhD abroad. Last year a few people got into Stanford PhD for CS.\n\nThe sports infrastructure is great too, I used to play table tennis 4 hours every day. The studies are hectic but that's just how survival is in a university with smart people.\n\nYou can't get better than NUST in Pakistan.",

            "I've studied in both - The Karachi campus NUST PNEC (for Electrical Engineering) and Islamabad campus Nust Business School for my MBA. \n\nI'm from Multan, thus not native to either cities.\n\nThe bottom line: \nThere are cons & pros to either campus.\n\nThe psychological toll of living alone in a hostel for the 1st time (which may not even be inside the university) is going to be massive but that growth will be visible once a year passes. But Islamabad is one of the best cities (in many aspects) to live away from home in Pakistan if one has to live away from home. \n\nThe pro of The karachi campus is that it's home. On the days you feel broken you still get to go home. Sleep on your own bed. Talk to your family. Have people take care of you. So that you can return to face the world the next day with a firm attitude. There is no hand holding in a hostel. You are living on your own with one or more roommates probably. \n\n-\nNust Islamabad is the most beautiful campus in Pakistan in a major city. \n\nNust karachi is like an army unit. But still pretty & mildly hilly considering the karachi landscape. \n-\nStudies are going to be the same in both - but campus life will be radically different. \n\n(The course curriculum is the same in both campuses for the same degree). \n\nIslamabad won't have a uniform. PNEC does have a uniform like colleges & schools. \n\n-\nPNEC was the campus that began student formula racing & electric racing but the navy admin will make life difficult at every step of the way. But they also have perks discounts on navy administratored stuff from time to time for the students. \n\nIslamabad campus (SEECS) will have slightly better labs & NSTP will give instant internship/job opportunities in the beginning while you search for major company openings and the city had hiking trails, other spots and winters + rains that make the campus life a world of its own.\n\nHope this helped. \n\nIf you have any further or specific questions, you can always DM.",

        "body": "I (M) became friends with a girl in university earlier this year.\n\nWe started talking because we shared similar interests. Conversations were mostly about uni, daily life, family stuff, stresses, and general personal topics. Nothing romantic or sexual.\n\nWe met a few times on campus, and eventually started hanging out roughly once a week on the same day. Texting was frequent too just normal friend conversations like how the day went, what’s going on, sometimes personal life , traumas past , goals , future , fears etc\n\nIn the very start I felt I might be oversharing (again, nothing romantic), so I explicitly said I won't share anything like that . She said it was fine.(but still I dropped that even though she said it was fine)\n\nShe also said things like she trusts me, considers me a good friend, and that I’m someone she could share things with and this continued sharing rants ,updates everyday\n\nRecently, things changed. For the past few weeks, every planned hangout has been cancelled with “next time” or “we’ll see,” and now even that isn’t being said. Replies to simple messages can take a day or more. In person, interactions feel much colder than before when we’re around mutual friends just a hi and then nothing else before she would invite , suggest plans\n\nI didn’t confront her because I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or guilty. But the sudden shift has made me really anxious. I’ve had panic type reactions thew up multiple times, mentally sicko and trouble focusing on my online business that I run\n\nWhat’s confusing is that she still interacts normally in group settings and on social media (likes stories), but 1-on-1 communication feels very distant.\n\nit just feels like Bread crumbing situation in friendship\n\nI’m trying to understand if this is just a case of someone wanting less emotional closeness,  \n(which is fine to have but I'm just confused)  \nbeing busy, or if the friendship is slowly fading. I genuinely value the friendship and don’t want to lose it,  \nI already lost many of best friends (males) and many faded slowly too\n\nI always get attached with people but I feel weak this time and don't want let her go because i don't see a problem or something\n\nDoes talking too much always leads to this ? she always cared though she used to ask if something is up, all good etc\n\nDoes things will become like before over time or what\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation where a close friendship slowly cooled down without a clear reason?  \nDid it ever recover with time, or is distance usually permanent?  \nAnd is it better to address it directly, or just give space and accept the change?\n\nPlease help me out give me some mental peace",

Communication is must and you need to to do it now before it's too late.

Do it now, Do it now. You are here to fix not hurt yourself and her and of she decides not to be friends with you. respect it and find other.

I was once a FAST and NUST aspirant too. I attended KIPS FUNG classes and also bought these books for practice. Honestly, they helped me a lot, especially the prep books, and I ended up securing admission in FAST (Data Science), UET (CS), and NUST (EE). After doing my research, I decided to join FAST.\n\nNow I’m looking to sell my FUNG series, which played a big role in my exam preparation. The set includes 10 books in total. Except for Physics and Mathematics, all the books are untouched. I’ve also made some notes in the prep books.\n\nI’m selling the complete set for 5000/-. DM me if you’re interested. Prices are slightly negotiable.\n\nP.S. I bought the set for 7500/-.",

            "Financial aid is not given based on merit. Rather, it is given based on financial standings. You will probably get it as you meet the requirements for Financial Aid. \n\nFA covers your semester fees, you will still have to give mess and hostel fee if I'm not mistaken. But after admission, you can extend your FA to cover both of these. I don't know the exact procedure but there is a guy in Main Office who is very helpful in case anyone wants to apply for FA of any sorts.\n\nAs for the employment status of your father. I don't know how you would proceed, but if none of the options make sense, then there should be \"other\" in the selection. \n\nI hope someone more knowledgeable will be able to help you further. If someone has the phone number of the FA uncle (his office is in Main Office) then do send it to her. \n\nAll the best!",

            "FA is not merit based. It is based on household income. Other than FA Nust also provides student loan facilities but you can only avail that after admission which means you would have to pay the 1st sem fee. I don't know how much each instalment is but you would have to pay the first instalment during uni and then the rest you can pay after graduation\n\nAs for the emplyment status you could select other if there is that option and then maybe give an affidavit which states the income. Whether or not you could submit the affidavit is unlcear. You should call nust helpline or email them explaining your issue I had some concerns about my admission and they do reply back.\n\nThe information below is from nust official website \n\nFor Queries Related To Scholarship:\n\nTelephone\n+92-51-8866828 or +92-51-90856828\n+92-51-8866839 or +92-51-90856839\n\nEmail\nfao@nust.edu.pk\n\n\n\n\n[https://nust.edu.pk/admissions/undergraduates/ug-admissions-help-desk/](https://nust.edu.pk/admissions/undergraduates/ug-admissions-help-desk/)",

            "If you have also applied at FAST University, they offer excellent financial assistance programs. For instance, if you secure admission but cannot afford the tuition, they may allow you to defer your fees. This means you can complete your degree and only begin repaying the amount once you graduate and secure a  job.\nOther Scholarship Options\nPEEF Scholarship: If you are a resident of Punjab, the PEEF scholarship is a great option. While I am unsure if a similar program exists at the federal level, it is worth investigating. I recommend reaching out directly to the university’s Accounts or Financial Aid Department. They can provide detailed information on all available scholarship types and eligibility criteria.",

            "Look, your plan is a bit of a half-measure. You’re spending four years and a lot of money on a BBA that won't actually teach you how the spare parts market works. Even if COMSATS is chill with attendance, you’re still losing prime time sitting in a classroom instead of the market.\n\nIf you’re dead set on the degree, aim higher, think about building a tech-based supply chain or an e-commerce brand, not just a local shop. Otherwise, Just do a few short courses in accounting and marketing and hit the market now. Don't waste four years just to end up doing something you could've started today.",

Jesa hi mera uni mai admission hoga us k sath hi mai sham ko market bhi join kr lo ga 3-4 saal kam seekho ga and then degree khatam ho jaye gi aur kam bhi seekh lia hoga market mai reh kr then apni shop khol lo gaa....

A lot of dropouts from archi every year. Faculty is Ok. Not bad and not extraordinary. \n\nNCA is also tough but not as much tough. Good thing about NCA is that they have big alumni. A lot of contacts for jobs. \n\nArchitecture is toughest department of NUST. Second toughest is Electrical engineering. \n\nLag pata jaay ga jab koi NUST k archi mein aay ga.",

            "Brother it's a problem with a lot of ppl these days, our brains can't retain info like before cuz of all the noise in our hands. Some effective ways to fix it is consistently practicing these (kind of) rituals targeted specifically for your studies:\nNote: don't tell me it doesn't work or that it's ineffective or some shit, you gotta try and practice it consistently for at least a week to believe that it DOES work (it's originally taken from the Silva technique, but it's not exact)\n\n1. Try studying early in the morning cuz obv that's when our brains are most alert and fresh \n\n2. Before you sit down to study, do some physical activity like 20 jumping jacks or something high intensity. \n\n3. When you're seated to start, close your eyes and feel at ease, one of the ways to do that is focus on each breath and count down (in your head) from 1-50 (u wouldn't need to count down that long once you get consistent with it, your brain will get used to slipping in to alpha state quicker, then you may only need to count back from 20 or even 10) \nTip: if you don't have somewhere quiet to do this, don't worry about your surroundings, just try and block out all noise even though you can hear it \n\n4. After counting backwards, imagine a blue circular barrier all around you, it encircles you and keeps your energy secure and blocks out any negativity and distraction (note: when I say it blocks something blah blah it means that you gotta believe and tell your brain that it's the time to lock in and SAVE the information your about to study) \n\n5. Say in your head that \" I am about to study (state your topic or subtopics ) and I'll be able to learn everything that I study when I open my eyes, noises will not distract me, noises will help me to concentrate\" now count from 1-3 open your eyes and start studying.\n\n6. When you're done studying, close your eyes again try to visualize what you've studied then say in your head \"I'll be able to recall all this information anytime in the future, accurately and quickly whenever I need to\"  (during this entire process u need to believe and think that whatever your saying in your head is ACTUALLY happening) \n\n7. Tip: do take breaks and don't try to study a lot of information all at once",

        "body": "I’m genuinely confused and need some guidance. I enrolled in Sir Hashim Zia’s Paid Batch 4 course, but the teaching sequence feels very random. We started with waves in physics today (sir Ronald 😪😴) and in maths analytical geometry(Hashim Zia ), which makes it hard to build concepts properly especially for someone like me who is from a pre-medical background. Coming from pre-med, it’s already difficult to jump into advanced topics without starting from the basics. I really need to begin with the first chapters, where foundational concepts and problem-solving tricks are taught, otherwise it becomes overwhelming to follow later topics.I’m not fully sure about Sir Aftab and Sir Bilal Zia’s overall flow yet, but another issue I’m facing is with Sir Ronald’s lectures he explains extremely slowly. I honestly felt sleepy during the lecture and end up pausing the video for 30 mins  and then watched it at 1.75x speed just to get through.\n\nNow I’m stuck. I actually want to start from the very first chapters and study properly at my own pace, possibly by watching previous lectures. But the problem is that they conduct bi-weekly tests, and if we miss three tests, the portal gets cancelled, which I really don’t want.\nIMPORTANT FOR PRE MEDD STUDENTS:\nAlso, for students coming from a pre-medical background, I’d genuinely recommend watching the two basic maths videos by Sir Bilal Zia available online. They help a lot in building fundamentals and easing the transition into maths WITHOUT CALCULATOR\n\nSo I’m confused about what to do:\nShould I follow the current random pace just for the sake of tests, or should I go back, start from basics, and risk falling behind in the testing schedule?.",

And 1st 2nd yr exams are easy to prepare I did that just in 3 months, with not alot of studytime per day. Then gave NTS and went to FAST Alhamdulillah"

        "body": "For context, im in IESE and have been lurking on the subreddit. And I only made this account after seeing a lot of posts about ppl being confused about my department or ASAB or IGIS etc. The minnows in the sea of the big fish departments like SEECs or SMME.\n\nAnd I feel you, because I think there is horrible marketing for these departments, especially for people currently giving NETs.\n\nHamaray alumni talks ya welcome waghera mein admin always quoted that one of our lecturers used to be a student of IESE, or that bahir shifa hospital mein koi kaam karahay hain health and safety mein expert, ya phir wastewater plant par research horahi hay. But im in UG and I want to relate to people who arent from PG, atleast for now. \n\nAnd gang, if I study env. science then my whole future shouldn't be confined to just worrying about jobs focused on wastewater and stuff. I do not want repeat the same things people stuck in IESE are doing, but I want to do more! isnt that what undergrad is about, to learn more and grow oneself more. On the other hand, I see people from this degree do such diverse things, and ham yahan phassay huay hain aik one dimensional perspective par, its like some cool seniors of ours are deliberately being hidden from us smh.\n\nMy rant is that, I had to do research myself and found that we have such cool people who graduated from NUST, even these \"insignificant\" departments like mine as opposed to bigshots like SEECS.\n\nInsta par proud nustians and even on nustgram par I saw this post bragging about how this alum from USPCASE is now working for the UN? And I was like, cool! But i checked and the guy was just doing a training course. And then, on the other end, meri feed par this senior named Abbas or something who apparently was from IESE and he's being posted about by the UN themselves as one of their experts in climate, jabke hamein yahan inke baray mein kuch nahe bataya kabhi bhee. Or Ameera Adil, who's a climate information influencer, never heard about her in my one year here. Similarly, there are other people like, another guy who is being posted about by EY ireland, this big consulting firm, naam nahe yaad but I saw him on LinkedIn. \nThe point being, why must all marketing be geared towards one perspective, why cant these departments pull these people into our schools. Let us talk to them, even virtually if theyre abroad, idk about you but id rather listen to the guys from EY or UN instead of whatever maam erum was teaching me about my career possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, from SMME there's a guy who literally runs unicornblack, the studio where they made Burqa avenger. Or that, the singer Umar Farooq, wo bhee NUST ka hay.\n\nSorry for the rant, but it frustrates me. I like my department but these places need to do more, I dont want people to think of me as a low merit person who had no other choice but IESE, but I want people to see that its also cool, and I chose to be here, bcs I did!\n\nEdit, someone dm'd me and said the name of the UN guy is Jaffar Abbas, and the EY guy is mubeen ud din.",

        "body": "Hi everyone. I’m a pre med student currently on a gap year preparing for mdcat. But as we all know, the medical field in Pakistan is super unpredictable with no clear policies and mdcat drama literally every year. Because of this I’m also thinking of applying for NUST as a backup.\n\nInitially, I was considering biotech, but then I started thinking that engineering or CS might have better scope compared to biotech. One of my cousins did BS biotechnology from Pakistan, then moved abroad and completed his MS from London, but he’s currently jobless, which honestly scared me a bit.\n\nMy main concern is the maths part of NET for CS/Engineering. As a pre med student with no FSc maths background, how difficult is it? Is it realistically possible to prepare for NET maths from scratch while also preparing for mdcat 2026?\n\nIf anyone here has cleared NET as a pre med student or has experience with this situation, please share your advice. I’d really appreciate honest guidance.\n\nThanks in advance",

            "Choosing CS just because it has “scope” is the dumbest reason to pick a degree.  \n  \nCS isn’t a lifeboat from MDCAT drama, it’s a field that destroys people who enter it for the wrong reasons.",
            "Honestly, I always wanted to go for cs/engr and even pre engineering during fsc, but my parents didn’t allow it. I ended up doing pre med and gave mdcat because that’s what they wanted. I tried, but I couldn’t secure it.\n\nNow I feel like at least I can say that I followed their choice once and it didn’t work out, so maybe now I should be allowed to choose the degree I actually want.\n\nPreviously, I was thinking of going for biotech since its entrance test has the same subjects I’ve already studied. But now I’m seriously considering CS or engineering but my only concern is the maths part. As a pre med student, you know we haven’t studied maths in FSc, so I’m not sure how manageable it is to prepare for NET maths from scratch.",
            "Okay, now it makes sense. It would’ve been better if you’d shared this context earlier. Anyways, There was a school friend of mine who picked pre med in college. He was the topper of that college having 95%+ in Matric and then 90%+ in inter. But just like you couldn't manage to get into any medical university. He took a gap year, prepared advanced maths and this year he made several attempts to get into NUST but unfortunately failed, but Luckily he managed to get into CS in FAST Isb.\n\nAs for you I'd say it's quite hard to prepare maths from very scratch but up to some extent it's manageable. If you don't get into NUST, not a big deal, prepare for NU test which is relatively easy and get into FAST which is honestly far better then NUST (academically)."

But as im on a gap i want someone to push me cuz i would work religiously for a week and then id waste days yk i get lazy. Also i heard that hashim zia’s course aint worth it cuz he makes you study maths that comes in IBA. (The qs difficulty is higher of iba). Soo what should i do. Fyi i did watch his yt maths lectures. \n\nIm not really a genius student, anyone who has scored well in net and has been an avg student pls tell your story aswell soo that motivation rahay😭🙏🏻. Everyone is out here saying MEHNAT KARO. But jou kar raha houta only he knows bolna asaan hai krna on the other hand……",

For example, large amounts come in from clients and then go out again to suppliers, inventory, and other business expenses. Only a small portion is actually left for household use.\n\nAdditionally, my uncle works with my father in the same business. There isn’t a formally separated partnership yet, so expenses related to my uncle’s family are also paid from the same account.\n\nBecause of this, our bank statement makes us look financially strong, even though our **actual household disposable income is limited**.\n\nI wanted to ask:\n\n* How should this be explained in the NFAAF form?\n* Is there a way to clarify business turnover vs. personal income?\n* Has anyone with a similar family business background successfully filled this section?\n\nAny guidance from seniors or applicants who’ve been through this would really help. Thanks.\n\nThis is honestly stressful because without need-based aid, studying at NUST or honestly any other uni would be very difficult for me.

            "Tbh not being anyone’s “first choice” growing up really does something to you, and people don’t talk about it enough. when the few people you get close to either leave, get taken away, or straight up hurt you, it just stacks up over time. Losing friends like that, betrayal, relationship pressure that’s a lot for one person to carry, especially mostly alone. none of this sounds dramatic or attention seeking, it just sounds exhausting. i don’t really have advice either, just wanted to say someone read this and related. you’re not invisible here sometimes surviving the day is already a win",

            "Hostel applications will open after the announcement of the first merit list (after some days of the completion of NET 4 result announcement). In the 2025 admissions, hostel has been allotted mostly on the basis of distance and Merit Position was not much entertained. So if you’re far from Islamabad and have a good MP, there is a good chance for you to get hostel within the 1st semester or else you’ll have to accommodate in the external private hostels in H13 sector or any other plan you have, that’s on you but The main Point is that Hostel applications are independent of what NET you give and its application opens after that stuff.

            "Yes. Limited seats in the hostel. So it’s kinda first come first serve policy. So the earlier your name appears on the merit list like the first or second list, the earlier you can secure hostel by paying the fee. I heard you can put a lower merit field preferred over your desired field, that way you will surely get in the first list of that field, so you can secure hostel, but when you get your name in 6th or 7th list of your desired field, you can switch the fields but still have the hostel. You can also visit private hostels and get some near the campus, tho every hostel has pros and cons.",
            "Yar 2025 admissions mein to Hostel (Majorly) Distance ki base pe allot hua hai. But Merit Position also worked a little bit. Pro tip: apply for the hostel instantly after the announcement of first merit list, Aur BTW my address was of Lahore And my aggregate was 81% but I have not been allotted the hostel room yet (I’m in 1st sem)",
            "U sure ABT that , like if I pay for the lower desired fee so do I have to pay again for the desired field or just a small amount for switching.",

            "Y ? Are U a girl or a boy .",
            "If your preference list is like this:\nCS\nCivil Engineering \nBlah….\nAnd because Civil has a lower merit and less people want to go here, you make it in the first list here…\nYou have to pay the admission fee to secure your seat. If not, you’re deleted. Then, as the days go by other merit lists starts rolling out. And for example you get in the third merit list of CS, then you’ll be upgraded to CS automatically, because CS was higher in preference. Now it’s kind of a risk, but if if you have solid merit, you can check it against last year’s second or third merit list to see if you’ll make it, and it’s not that bad of a risk. You can apply for hostel as soon as you get in any field’s merit list. That secures your seat. Then, when you upgrade to your desired field, you can still have hostel.\nIf your merit list was like this:\nCivil Engineering \nCS…\nAnd you get in the first list of Civil Engineering, then you get in 3rd list of CS, they won’t upgrade you, because you prefer Civil more…\nThey do say on website that you get one chance to reorder your preference.\n\nIn case 1, the upgrading is based on preference and that’s completely free of cost. You have to pay the fees in 3-4 days or idk to lock in. And there are many students of higher merit that don’t pay the fees, go to another college or prefer some other field, or simply that there’s 1000 seats and first list only has 200 kids, so they’ll release 2nd list and so on.\nIn case two, you can change your preference as they say:\n\n“ “Change of Preferences” performa available on https://nust.edu.pk/downloads/forms/ and paying the prescribed fee. The subject change depends upon availability of seat and attained merit position, and is only valid during current selection process. Candidates can avail this option only ONCE during the selection process”\nSo yeah…",

            "yes, taking the NET is a better option because it gives you a higher chance of admission. However, if you’re from the British curriculum, the ACT may suit you better since it’s more aligned with what you’ve studied. ACT/SAT seats are very limited, so you usually need a higher score. That said, it also depends on the specific program you’re applying for. You can ask the university about last year’s average score and plan accordingly"

            "1. Mene Kips Academy Join ki\nThi, mock tests aur unki books se consult Kia aur majorly concepts saare wahi se clear kiey aur Tricks pe focus kia kyuke Maths aur Phy ke har question ko solve krne ki trick hai. Aur Mene Pass Education system ka Premium Batch Lia tha friend se (usne apne mail pe buy kia Mene wo apni device pe login krlia ). But merepas Maths ki tricks ka ek pdf hai I’ll share\n\n2. Mene academy to kafi pehle hi join krli thi (long FUNG Course mein) lekin NET 1 ki serious prep test date se 20 days pehle shuru hui. English ko completely ignore kia Maths only 11 and Phy 11 and half 12 syllabus and scored 132 then NET 2 mein Kafi effort ki aur Eng Ko is trha prepare kia ke Grammatical Mistakes pe focus kia aur Comprehension pe kyuke Baaqi synonyms waghera purely tukka hai and got 142 in NET 2 (I attempted all 4). \n\n3.Mcq ko Prho piece by piece Aur Samjho Ke Required Kya hai, Jahan pe yr Samaj gaye aur question ki logic Samaj gaye it’s half solved. Don’t be much quick as you will definitely get those mcqs wrong about whom you’d be fully sure that are correct (my experience).",
            "4. Physics ka ye guess lagana almost impossible hai ke mcqs kahan se ayein ge kyuke kisi bhi net mein kahin se bhi aa skta hai kuch bhi left out hoskta hai maybe Sara NET 12 se ajaye maybe 11 se, so it’s unpredictable. Moreover Physics Ki Book lines bhi aati hen most people won’t agree with my this argument lekin 4 NET dene kr baad I’ve found out ke Kuch mcqs aese bhi hote jo agr apne book read ki ho to answer pata lg jata hai aur unit conversions, formula conversions are just minor thing out of whole physics but don’t ignore them. Physics ke 2 types ke questions aate hen theoretical aur Numerical, theoretical ka scene Mene apko bata dia wo book lines aati mostly, real issue numerical mein aata, uski tyari hevi krni prti, do remember ke agr ek question calculator ya zyada time require kare Mtlb wo NET main ni ayega. NET mein complex questions aate lekin within 60-90 seconds mein solvable hote if you find the core logic of what actually is the Examiner asking",
            "Pro Tips: \n\nA. Time Management ka Scene ye hai ke some apna time English Se Save krna hai apko English ka portion uske allocated time se kafi pehle krna hoga taake aap phy aur maths keliey time nikal sako kyuke itna koi bhi intelligent ni hota ke saare mcqs under 56 seconds krle ek bhi especially phy aur maths ke so save time from English.\n\nB. English ki ek aur protip ye ke kisi synonym ka agar apko faintest idea bhi nai hai to uska wo option kabhi bhi answer ni hoga ko apko Sabse Sahi lag raha hoga, Aur jo apko Sabse irrelevant lage uske correct answer hone ke Sabse zyada chances hen I’ve experienced it myself and this trick works most of the cases",
            "Aur Kuch Hukm Sir",
            "Guru g bat aise hay I am on a gap year I know physics ki books ki lines aati Hain but wo mcqs bhi itny difficult hoty Hain KY pha\" jati hay \nMaths main tricks bht Hain Maine bhi use ki thi Lekin 40-50% mcqs bht zyada difficult hoty Hain KY 3 hours main bhi solve nhi hoty aur English to Maine 8 9 minutes main kr li thi koun KY bilkil nhi aarhi thi \nAb advice dain koi achi si?"

We are literally expected to memorize random articles and get questions like \" who said this dialogue\"...after reading those assigned 100 pages. The courses are HORRIBLE and there's no flexibilty for you to pick and design your own curriculum like how it is in Lums, iba or the rest of the world. I am forced to study english literature - which is something not even related to my degree. The quality of the courses themselves is downright horrible - the way they are structured and taught and tested is so so bad. Not a lot of room for development through the university / ECs which is very important for business. Horrible management of things - you are bombared with makeup classes all the time to the point where i have 9 to 5s almost daily because of their mismanagement. And im a business major. Its just very fsc college core. All in all genuinely ive never been to a worse institution. My elementary, middle school etc were better.\nAnd this is just what I can remember off the top of my head.",
            "And they also make things unnecessarily hard for you for no reason. You'd be better off going go a more relaxed university and building your skillset. Over here you can do neither because they overload you with their senseless pointless work. See now if it was something that would actually help me, I wouldnt complain - my problem doesn't lie with working hard. But it's all useless stuff.

And as usual you can change the answer by erasing the previous selection completely ( of course you have to use a pencil for this ).

            "As someone who joined by choice, it's definitely not what I imagined. Not the core subjects ie.fundamentals of programming (I enjoy that) but the subjects like calculus and discrete maths do wear me out. Everything is just like college apart from occasional fun activities with friends in the sports complex and khappa wagera. It's a fucking rat race here. And same morning wake up go to uni do shit and come back or maybe it's just me who can't accept that this is reality and it stays this way even after getting a job. And let me tell you CS guys are way too competitive and you have to be as well.(This has its own advantages as well cause being in the company of intelligent people is a good thing for some peeps as well) Otherwise you might feel left out and there are things which I wonder about sometimes with regards to the future of this degree. Met a senior another day whom I asked about a project for the first semester and he told me he used AI for his project and still uses Claude and jokingly said who even codes himself nowadays. It definitely left me thinking and that another day I just used gpt for a game idea that I had to test on raylib and it gave me the complete code. I'll try to code myself of course for understanding but I do wonder the use of that. Isn't it redundant to do that. Discrete is also a double edged sword, I enjoy it but don't get good marks in quizzes due to terrible time management and in mids I barely was above average. Calc paper was way difficult for us peeps. ICT and English instructors are teaching their subjects in a way to boring style. ICT is dry as well apart from some topics . Fehm e quran I don't mind. Thora sa waqt to banda khuda KO de deta hain. Time is moving too fast and sometimes samajh Nahi ati Zindagi ki. One last piece of advice. Sit down and ask yourself? You really wanna do this? Would you be willing to sit in front of a computer for 3 hours straight at a time(labs and stuff and in future office work) or you're not that type of guy. You're someone who enjoys going out and engaging with people and stuff. Would you be willing to hit your head against the wall in front of a big problem you have to solve ? These are some challenges. It's not that bad of a field . I do like that there isn't much to memorise but more to solve which wasn't the case in FSC where we had to rote learn stuff. And doing maths and discrete can be fun sometimes. It all depends on where your heart lies. The next 4 years will certainly be interesting with regard to changes in this field and its scope. Allah knows best :)",
            "He sounds jealous 😭😭  CS is a little oversaturated but it is one of those few fields where if a sector becomes obsolete/ automated ( like web dev) then something new pops up ( devops, big data etc etc). Its about being smart with it. And honestly if you're interested in it then its a good field to go into. But if youre not into it and are just going in for \"prestige\" money wagera then rethink it because everyone ive met who's done CS says you cant succeed in it if you dont enjoy it just a little bit even because its very tough",
            "Yo, CS is very bad, pfp me dekhlo 1 semester ne mera kia haal krdia. Harifall hogya aur me haklay jesa dikhny lg gya hun\n\n\nNvm, CS isn't that bad. It's all about what you're learning. If its your passion, follow it",
            "Cs aint bad bro u can still have a good career in it. It is just k ab u cant be avg coz there are a ton of people who do it now so have to be really good to stand out and personally i believe that you can earn in any job if you stand out in it like in 99% of the fields",
            "I am CS grad, have been working in industry for good while, now completed software engineering.\n\nCS isn't bad, it's how you tackle the change in the technology, it's not like maths once you're done you're done, you need to be up to date with the industry and keep excelling on regular basis.",
            "I hope all fine,Every subject in bachelor are diffult,You need spent alot of time in it.So CS is not Bad.If you want to really make sucessfull in c,you need to spend alot lf time and understand the concept.Again and again pratice the code. Like Koi cheez asan ni Aik insan ko harldle krni tb jo hasil kr pata hai",
            "It has a simple answer. \nWhy are you choosing CS?\nDo you know how to code? Not just printing hello world but actual coding?\nIf you know that that means you are actually enthusiastic about this field and in that case you should go for it. \nBut if you dont know that, this means you are choosing this field because of how things are these days. In that case I don't recommend it because you are not really passionate about this field. \nIf you still think you are passionate then you should atleast be able to answer what things you will study in this course. Don't know this too? \nMaybe you should think it thru again.",
            "Honestly speaking, CS is not bad for anyone who is willing and craves it. As a freshman at SEECS, I can say that I'm quite satisfied with what I've achieved. As far as relatives are concerned, I too had my fair share of \"successful intelligent\" relatives which didn't even know what a CS degree actually is.\n\nMoreover, people say CS is too saturated in Pakistan and the whole world. But, the big reality is, although it is saturated, it has room for dedicated people and willing students who want to mark a milestone. I say, if you're sure that you like CS, then definitely go for CS no matter what anyone says. Whether it be your bare cousins, yelling relatives, or even your peers, they'll stop their chatter after some time.\n\nLast piece of advice: Give your best and leave the rest to Allah. Good luck for NETs and university admissions.\n\nMay Allah open doors for you and you get what you deserve. Ameen",

So once all NETs are done, a merit list will be created for those who gave the Engineering/Computing NET.\n3- This merit list will be based on your aggreagte (75% NET, 15% Fsc, 10% Matric).\n4- The one with the highest aggreagte, will get the merit position of 1. Let's say, 85% aggregate.\n5- Us sai neechay, at 84.9%, the person will have merit position 2. And this will go on for ALL the candidates that gave the test.\nSo obviously, if the top 50 selected Computer Science, aur Computer Science ki seats bhi 50 hi hon, to the merit cuff of for computer science will be at 50.\nBut if the person at the 5th merit number says \"hey, I want to do something else\", then the person at the 51st list will get its position.

But some people associated with the uni says that there is difficult to settle in the gov uni environment specially with the fact that I love to study through research and logic based learning, whereas faculty in UET is more focused on \"Ratta like learning\" as typical mindset in Pakistan. So I decided to go for NUST test too (NET). But on other hand, I have red on this sub that HEC syllabus for CS is all same and there is only the difference of campus grooming and facilities. I am not too obsessed with both above mentioned factors and just wanted to ensure that I can interact with good faculty members who can teach on the basis of concepts and thought based learning. Does anyone (preferably a senior from NUST or UET) kindly guide me on this matter.\n\nPS. I have complete details about the fee and expenditure factor, student bodies and other things including employment rate, abroad admssion for Masters, rather I am just concerned about the learning.",

            "a bit late to the party but I’ll be honest. as an a levels student currently studying at uet lahore it takes some time adjusting to the environment here which you say is not much of a concern. ratta culture definitely exists here especially among inter students but it's not like the teachers force you to blindly memorize everything rather they actually do push you to understand concepts and apply logic\n\nand as far as i see things, you simply cant get through a cs or ce (in my case) degree without logical thinking. at some point even the students who rely heavily on ratta hit a wall and it’s game over for them, you can see it in their results they barely scrape through certain subjects.\n\ni had straight A\\*s in O and A Levels and that background is paying off. the logical foundation helps me stay at the top of the class alhamdulillah. yet i'll still suggest that you reconsider at least once, would you prefer the comfort of your own city (uet), or a better university environment? (nust). while you cant go wrong with both, cause parhna at the end of the day aap nai khud hee hai or career bhee aapnay khud hee banana hai. but whatever your decision is, you'll have to stick with it for the next four years. good luck mate.",

In ssc I chose biology but later converted into Cs as it's quite evolving in the future ahead. But now that I look around me, almost everyone is choosing C's to pursue just because they think ke iska scope he. To escape the rat race, I chose Cs but to consider that I'll graduate in 2030, I think the market would get too saturated.\n\n\n\nNow as for me I've always wanted to do something that earns me respect and fame make my media presence. A career that opens global opportunities for me. I considered law initially but as I dig deep into it, I realized by law I don't necessarily look forward to defending client within the premises of courtroom but rather emerge as a representative in Un councils as diplomat it or stuff since I love doing muns and more specifically public speaking.I don't really wanna get stuck behind a desk but rather pursue a career that provides me the flexibility to travel globally.

I found college life easy and enjoyable but here it feels way worse. This world just praises your hardships, but why would anyone want that?\n\nI am not really a \"gifted\" person, as some people call it, and have to spend more time just to get the same results. I don't want to be here chasing grades, but at the same time, I want to be on the smarter side as I don't have anything else to offer, am physically weak, not rich(parents), abysmal communication skills, being not really good at anything, no friends and carrying the ever increasing traumas of life. I feel like I don't belong here among these smart people, not willing to spend 4 more years of life doing this and then who knows how many more years of this life.\n\nEveryday just feels more miserable than ever, spending 10hrs in uni, just to get home and spend remaining hours studying or doing something \"productive\" just to fit in and then 6hrs sleep. Wake up and be ready to do this all over again. I just want to quit but I don't really have a choice, people expect you to perform well and maintain your position no matter how hard it is for you, which I honestly don't care about what they say or think but when your inner self and people you're around the most are like this then you have to care about this. Maintaining this position is hard but at the same time I also don't want to fall. .\n\nI got in my field of interest, not my dream, and I don't have a \"dream\" field. People say someone would be happy to be where I am but I don't know if I should feel good about it or not considering I spend months suffering sometimes even 20hrs a day studying which I know isn't the best choice. I thought net was just a phase and there was light on the other end but I have ended up in the dark trapped and I don't know how to free myself.

I was honestly a pretty mediocre student — not because I was weak, but because I never really bothered with studies. I’d only study near finals, and that mindset eventually led to a 2.20 CGPA.\n\nDespite that, I landed a decent government job after graduation and I’ve been working there ever since. I plan on staying in this job long-term.\n\nRecently though, I’ve started feeling bad about wasting my academic potential back then. So I decided to take the GAT, and I ended up scoring an 80 aggregate (95.77 percentile) on my first attempt. No idea if that’s actually good, but it made me think seriously about pursuing a master’s degree.\n\nThe problem is: it’s been 8 years, and I remember almost nothing from my bachelor’s. Zero recollection of most technical subjects.\n\nSo I could use some guidance from people who’ve been through this.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Should I even go for a master’s degree at this point?\n\n\n2. If yes, should I take some time to refresh and rebuild my technical foundation before applying? Or should I go for something less technical like Engineering Management?\n\n\n3. Are there good job opportunities for someone with an Engineering Management degree? Like if i ever want to go in public sector or even think about going abroad will it do me any good?\n\n\n\nWould appreciate any genuine advice. Thanks!\n",

            "What do you hope to get from a masters? You’re much older than me, probably around 9 years or so and probably know better than me, but im graduating this year, and thinking of a masters or phd too. Im pretty sure i don’t want to work in a typical plant or office 9-5 (internship at engro made that very clear) and i would much rather work in a research role where i have to actively recruit my technical ability. There’s very few such opportunities for a ME graduate here in Pakistan, therefore im looking abroad for graduate programs as a means to that end. That being said, I’m still not sure if i will take an offer if given one. I don’t know exactly how my future will take shape in that situation and I don’t know if i will be happy then.\n\nSo, what I’m trying to say is you need to be clear what you hope to get out of your masters degree. How will it help you? Is it just regret on your part over not having done good during your bachelors? Or do you want to actually shift gears somehow. If you plan on staying on your current job, i don’t see how a masters will be useful for you. \n\nGood luck bro.",

            "Don’t be in the illusion that it’ll be enough. NET is there to distinguish between average and top students.\n\nTherefore, their provided practice material is excellent but not enough. \n\nHere’s some additional material:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SflMtC_JFsPT93IOJwowW9ztzSSeMhr2\n\nIncludes KIPS, Torcia and many other books etc.\n\nPlay smart here, first revise the basic concepts, read the textbook, then start practicing as much as you can try giving atleast 2 days to a chapter, and even more for lengthy and difficult chapters. Every week try to do a mock test (just for time management) try mcqs from past.\n\nYou’ll have to work atleast 12-14 hours a day but you’ll make it. Just have self confidence. As for english I believe that their provided material sufficient, just be sure to review past papers. Join channels like Nustrive on instagram they give you a glimpse of papers during NET so you can review and some questions do get repeated.\nAs for physics, I would say first ensure you’ve grip of federal books, highlight important lines and revise them.\nFor maths you first prefer easiest practice book then move forward to next level.\nRemember: Don’t lose courage, hope. If you think you’ve lost then it means you’ll. So never lose in your mind. You can win, you just need to be smart, efficient and hardworking. And ensure you work on your weak points, my guess is you fumbled hard because of time management too. While attempting paper start from Question 1 and move forward and attempt those questions which can be done with memory or just a little bit of thinking. Once you’ve done alot of questions in round-1. Move forward to round 2. By the end of test you’ll be extremely happy since you would’ve attempted majority of the questions.\n\nTo be concise, prepare, don’t be stressed, and manage the time properly, attempt weekly mock tests (can only be from the topics you know). Not an AD but I use parhako.com for mock-tests. \n\nBest wishes!",
            "I can understand being in your shoes.\n\nYou’ve to prepare efficiently, try mastering the topics which most students consider difficult. Strictly use Federal Books for Maths and Physics. Especially physics read the book thoroughly as most of the questions seem to be theoretical based. For english, make sure you learn limited words but you must have grip on them.\n\nIn the end, you must have best time management because the test itself isn’t very difficult, you just need to be able to solve the questions no matter how weird/lengthy within time constraints. Remember don’t be stressed. If Allah Almighty wants you studying in NUST, it’ll happen no matter what. So just study efficiently, ensure you manage your time well. And practice using OETP, kips & Torcia. Don’t just “see” the solutions, crash lectures etc. You just need an intellectual mind with basic skill. And you’ve to refine it using practice, practice and practice. Your base must be strong, you need to speed up your calculation by Atleast twice or thrice the current speed. Try doing a-lot of self-paced study, and make sure to not attempt as many questions as you can but quality questions, which challenges you. And don’t think ever that you’ve learnt everything, believe me no body does. So better instead of being over confident, work so efficiently and smartly along with hint of handwork that you have mastered your weak points and turned them into strong ones so that in the end you’ll be able to perform well. Believe in the Allah Almighty and yourself. \nBest wishes",

            "You can't memorize the meaning of every word you come across. It's just not feasible. Instead, it's always recommended to learn the roots so you can at least guess what that word could mean. Learn as much as you can of Latin and Greek roots. At least this is how I learn words, but be careful since a word's meaning can differ based on the context. \n\nFor the grammar: I recommend using Khan Academy and Grammarly. Grammarly is for notes, and KA is for notes and practice. I'm preparing for the SAT, and I learnt the use of semicolons, colons, and hyphens in a span of a week. \n\nI can send you a link to an English grammar book and practice questions if you want. Wren and Martin is a solid book too. Start reading, then learn the meanings of words you don't know, and make 2-3 sentences at the same instance. Read out loud.",

They don't cause any problems mostly stay away from people, the most I've seen happen is someone taking a 10 step detour if the dog is in the way. Your exaggerated complaints of danger are what pushed the admin to shoot bolt last time, so keep it up ig. Crazy how u compare animal lives to human live cause YOUR LIVES AREN'T IN DANGER, THEIRS ARE.",

That clearly reflects where you’re coming from.\nPlease take a moment to observe the condition of the dogs on campus. They are visibly scared when a human approaches them.\nWe are doing our best to care for the animals on campus, we collect donations, take them to the vet, and ensure they receive proper treatment. We are fully in favor of TNVR. If we can vaccinate and neuter cats, then dogs are not a problem for us either.\n\nThe real issue is the administration. They do not allow us to take the dogs to clinics for vaccination or TNVR.\nAs a member of this community, it’s important to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.\nPlease try to see the situation from another perspective, and don’t make this already miserable world even worse for anyone.",

Could you please explain how to apply for these scholarships, what the eligibility requirements are, and whether I must apply to them even if I am applying for NFAAF?\n\n2. If I am not eligible for these external scholarships, will that stop me from receiving NUST financial aid?\n\nAlso, does my father’s income have to be below 60,000 PKR or is the NDI (Net Disposable Income—the difference between income and expenses) the only main factor used to decide eligibility?

I've heard some rumours that the faculty of S3H is not very good, but needed some direct feedback from those currently enrolled for BS psychology in NUST. Kindly, anyone who is a student there for psychology, tell me\n• how your experience has been with the teachers,\n• are the teachers for psych mostly females or males as well ,\n• if they're good at explaining material, \n• hows the workload \n• and so on, any other feedback or observations that you made of the campus that caught you off guard.\n\n I would really appreciate it and be grateful for any review/feedback/advice/response. \n\nThank you.",

        "body": "Hi everyone,\nI never thought I would post here, but I’m genuinely lost and mentally drained right now. I need honest opinions from people who’ve been through this before.\n\nSo here’s my situation:\n\nI did FSc Pre-Medical and (like many people in Pakistan) got pushed into preparing for MDCAT even though I was never fully sure about becoming a doctor. I’d say I wanted it only 40–50%. I always had interest in CS/engineering fields too, but the pressure at home was insane.\n\nThen suddenly, PUCIT gave me an admission offer.\nBut I only had 3–4 days to join, and that too at a time when MDCAT was only a month away. I wasn’t mentally, physically, or emotionally ready to move to hostel and start a whole new life while preparing for MDCAT.\n\nI cried a lot and didn’t join.\nI thought I’d focus on MDCAT.\nBut I couldn’t clear it.\n\nNow my mom says,\n“TUM NE PU KO APNI MARZI SE CHORA.”\nWhich is just not true.\nI was cornered with zero stable direction.\n\nNow I’m stuck.\n\nI want to switch to CS/Software Engineering.\n\nI didn’t join PUCIT.\n\nCOMSATS admissions are open but I’m unsure.\n\nPeople say COMSATS is “average,” but also say its CS is good.\n\nI’m scared of taking admission somewhere and regretting it forever.\n\nI’m also scared of taking a gap year and disappointing myself or my family again.\n\nPart of me wants to try for FAST/NUST but I’m scared I won’t make it, especially because I haven’t started Maths yet (coming from pre-med).\n\nMy mom doesn’t support the gap year idea and keeps saying “drama mat banao.”\n\nI have no one who genuinely tries to understand what I’m going through.\n\n\nI’ve reached a point where the thought of university makes me cry.\nI feel like I’m standing in a blind alley with no right choice in sight.\n\nI need real advice:\n\n1. Should I take a gap year, study maths from scratch, prepare for NUST/FAST, and keep COMSATS as a backup?\n\n\n2. Or is COMSATS a good enough option and I should just go there without overthinking?\n\n\n3. Is it risky to start CS without a strong maths background?\n\n\n4. Has anyone else gone from pre-med → CS? How hard is the transition?\n\n\n5. Is it normal to be this confused after family pressure + MCAT failure? I genuinely feel mentally exhausted.\n\n\n\nAnything honest will help. I’m not looking for sugarcoating — just real guidance.\n\nThank you.",

            "studying maths from scratch means You'll cover ur syllabus and concepts till net 3-4 which is in june july and idk where are u from or which campus will u prefer , but getting into Computing fields in main campus require above 77 merit which means u have to ace it . Now its up to u how much u can cover till June. btw mdcat hota hai Sept-oct main ig? bio toh aati hi hogi , focus on maths give multiple Nets (3 and 4) hogya toh its a win , nhi hua toh Mdcat dubara dedena ... In short you'll have to cover both simultaneously .(PLUS IF U R JUST GOING TO ESCAPE FROM MEDICINE AS MDCAT CLEAR NHI HUA , AND U DON'T HAVE BASICS OF PROGRAMMING , YOU'LL REGRET SM GETTING INTO CS OR SE . SO BETTER IF U MAKE IT START CODING FROM DAY 1)",
            "[removed]",
            "1. If you are going into computing fields, I believe it’s better that you’ve the knowledge of mathematics and programming. It is essential in computing programs, otherwise you’ll be left out, feeling “unable to understand” the courses. Yes, I would say take a gap year and study maths. \n2. COMSATS, in my opinion, is a university which mostly students only consider as backup and ends up getting into it, which makes it a hub for “the students who couldn’t go anywhere else but were accepted by COMSATS”. It’s a good university but not to the level of FAST/NUST in terms of CS (Purely as per my knowledge).\n3. If you start building a house without a strong base, don’t you think it will collapse? I mean you can take admission, but maths will be your limiting factor. You need it as your power to advance!\n4. Yes, I’ve transitioned. I am currently preparing for NET-2, I had a good score in NET-1 but just to be on “the safe side”. I don’t think it is hard at all, you just need to do this:\nFollow Federal Maths/Physics books strictly (Doing PTB will not cut it).\nPrepare the hardest chapters the best.\nPractice first using OETP, then kips, then torcia.\nAnd remember test isn’t very difficult, you can ace it only if you manage your time well and attempt test without taking stress. Pareshani kisi masle ka hal ni ha bro.\nLastly, don’t be in despair, yes its fine to be this confused. But this world isn’t made for the weak and only favours the winners, the strong people. You’ve to keep your morale up, be strong, and start the journey with the name of the Allah Almighty. \n\nBest wishes!",

I barely have a social life and only have two or three close friends, and we meet maybe once every few weeks or months.

If I join now, I’d be starting from the first semester, and for some reason that makes me feel weird or “behind”.\n\nSo I want to ask people who’ve actually been through uni or taken non-traditional paths: should I join a university just for the social experience? Is it even worth it for one semester? And on top of that, I don’t know much about universities in general. Is NUS a good option or is that unrealistic for me?\n\nAny advice or perspective would help",

        "body": "Assalam u Alaikum. I’m writing this because I have been living with regret, confusion, guilt and depression for almost two years now, and maybe someone from NUST will finally tell me what to do with my life. I come from a simple middle class family, was always an above-average student, and the first girl in my home who was going to university. After FSc premed in 2022, I spent a year on MCAT but couldn’t clear it. During that gap year, I randomly gave NET by self studying from the internet and on 15 November 2023, NUST emailed me that I got admission in BS Food Science and Technology. I can’t explain the happiness I felt that day; my father arranged the entire fee in two days by even taking a loan, and I joined NUST. The moment I entered NUST, I fell in love with everything the environment, the teachers, the aura, the professionalism. It felt like I had entered a place where I truly belonged. But because it was the first batch of Food Science, students used to discuss “scope,” and since I had no exposure and a very perfectionist mindset, I got extremely insecure. I have always had this unhealthy habit since childhood that I get influenced by others very quickly, and I compare myself to everyone. So instead of trusting the process, I panicked and started looking at CS because YouTube was constantly telling me “CS has money, remote jobs, scope, skills matter not university,” etc. Even though I hated maths since childhood, even though I didn’t even understand what coding was, even though I was genuinely happy at NUST, I convinced myself that Food Science had no scope and CS was the “real career.” Without even visiting the campus, without guidance, without thinking for even one proper week, I made the stupidest decision of my life: I left NUST after just one month and took admission in COMSATS Attock in January 2024 just because it was near my home. I genuinely believe no one in Pakistan has made a more foolish decision than I did. The shock began the moment I stepped into COMSATS Attock — the environment felt like a completely different world: strict, judgmental, zero grooming, weak faculty, and no academic culture. I had gone from a top university to a place where even basic coding wasn’t taught properly, and I couldn’t do even the simplest assignments. But now I was stuck. I kept telling myself “BSCS will give me money,” but the truth was that I had zero aptitude for CS. I couldn’t do logic, I couldn’t do coding, maths scared me, and my mental health completely collapsed. Every day I woke up with regret about NUST; every night I slept with the same regret. My GPA in COMSATS is 2.9 even though getting a 3.5 there is the easiest thing. I have done ZERO projects. I am now in 4th semester but I genuinely don’t know even basic programming, because I am naturally weak at maths and logics even in matric I was good in al subjects and was so bad at maths ,even thn I choose CS,that's much level of foolishness .One more thing the nust oppurtunities and environemnt ,I missed so much.Comsats attock is like random degree government college with no system and the shame I hold within myself that I left pakistan top institute and join the worst university and that trauma is making me mad . My father has always been supportive — even after spending 10–12 lakh on my education, he told me I could quit if I wanted, even though our income is in thousands. But I’m scared that if I can’t clear NET and leave my degree midway, what will happen,this fear is also attach with me. For 1.5 years my life has been depression, regret, crying, and stalking NUST videos and reels every single day like a person stuck in the past. I feel like everyone who stayed at NUST is living in heaven while I threw away my entire future because of fear, comparison, and FOMO. I went to a career counsellor recently and he told me openly that I have zero aptitude for technical fields; my strengths are in public administration, social sciences, management roles. And honestly, I know he’s right. I’m good with communication and leadership, not coding. But now I’m stuck: Should I continue BSCS just because I’ve already wasted time? Should I prepare NET again and try for Public Administration or Food Science again in 2026? But then I think: I did FSc in 2022… So I will finish a degree in 2030 because of my own mistakes at the age of 26 And what about money? What about job prospects? What about my age? At the same time I think maybe I should just finish BSCS somehow and then do MS Human Resource Management and shift to management side. But is that even practical when I’m not learning anything in BSCS? I’m mentally exhausted, emotionally unstable, have memory issues now, cry daily, hate myself for leaving NUST, and feel like I have destroyed not only my own career but also my father’s hard-earned money. I know all this sounds stupid and messy, but I swear my intentions were never wrong  I just had zero exposure and no guidance. Please helpI know I made a bad decision and I’m ashamed of it. My mental health has suffered, I’ve developed several issues during this period, and I feel like my whole personality has changed. I constantly feel as if my life is ruined. now I genuinely want advice from NUST students and alumni: What should I do now? Should I leave BSCS and start a fresh BS in Public Administration or Food Science at NUST in 2026? Will it be worth it even if I graduate late? Or should I somehow drag BSCS till the end and then switch to MS Human resource Management? Please guide me honestly. I don’t know what to do. My life feels stuck in regret and trauma.",

Make use of that because agar parents support karrahe hain to tension kya.\nAs for the age factor - honestly id say ke you can be worried about everything BUT age. I just joined university and there are people from all ages and backgrounds. Not everyone has a linear timeline and that's okay. There's even some people who are older than 25 who are starting university. A lot of these people have left their previous universities and degrees. A lot joined later.

            "You already have spent 2 years in comsats (as you’re in 4th semester) plus CS degree holds immense value in Pakistan. After doing public ad. And food science you wont have much options in the future. I suggest you complete your remaining years in comsats as just 2 more years are left. And as far as your 2.9 GPA, gpa doesn’t matter as much as internships do. If you leave your current degree and retake NET , you’d have to start from scratch here. Either try for an exchange program in NUST if its possible (if you have higher contacts). I’d suggest it’s just 2 years guzar lo. Waqt hei hai guzar jayta hai. Nust aint harvard. Plus nust ki fees bhi zada ho rahi hai har saal. Currently ig its around almost 300k. So dekhlo",
            "W alaikum aslam I'm A nustian and one thing I must nust is best in many things. And I have done electrical engineering but I'm working as a brand designer because I don't like electrical but I like to design despite doing engineering I have made my name in design industry worked with big brands and one more thing I earned more then all these CS graduates\n\nAnd about your whole story it's tiring but I must say what you want to do do it I have gap year for nust and I'm really proud on it and now I graduated from nust sounds like a dream but nust changed my whole life. So I suggest leave all the shit and try to prepare for net and get admitted in NUST again and along with that start some side hustle like freelance like Content writing or something similar fields I'm damn sure you are good at writing things. This side hustle will give you money freedom as well and this time instead of spending your father's money you actually earned your own money and spend on your own studies it will remove you from left behind and every field has a scope don't listen to people talk they are big shit\n\nIn the End best wishes for you as well.

            "Hey, I am a NUST alumni and well, not exactly in your shoes but I can very relate with you. Just take a minute and pause and let yourself know that this feeling of regret, embarrassment, failure will all fade away slowly with time. Take a few days or even months off and try to see what is it that YOU want to study/do in life. Is it medicine? Food science? CS? Etc. Once you have made up your mind, then go pursue that. Your one concern is that you have already spent 2 years and if you restart bachelors then you will finish it by 30. Listen, I am a PhD student in the USA and I also work as a teaching assistant and half of the students in my class are 25+. I even have students who are in their 30s 40s and even 60s and they just started the bachelors. Graduating at 30 is LITERALLY NOTHING. If you restart, look into this perspective; do you want to be miserable or exhausted or in full regret by the time you are in your 30 or being happy that you pursued something that you truly wanted to do? \nYour second worry is money spent, then tell me is the money more important than your mental health? If you were a parent, and you spent around 10-15lakhs on your daughter but later she wanted to switch fields because she was UNHAPPY, wouldn’t you allow it? You answered yourself that your dad is supportive and this is what parents are for. Inshallah in future you can help your dad in much greater ways. Now talking about job perspectives, now that’s only an issue for Pakistan. But if you have the right skills, then you 1000% can find a job and scholarship abroad. You will just have to work hard during your undergraduate (maintain a good cGPA, publish some research paper, internships, etc). You will just need to work hard. I hope life makes things easier for you and my only advice would be to pursue what you want to do. Don’t feel stuck here because you are not.",

            "1. Why would you 'continue' torturing yourself when you can say goodbye to the past and have a fresh start?\n\n2. For you, people shouldn't exist. Nor what they do with their lives. Or how far they have already travelled. What should truly matter for you is to make sure that you're happy with what you do.\n\n3. Good things happen when you stop catering to the bad things. Why would you continue CS if you don't even belong there? Mistake. Regret. Repent. All these words exist for a reason.\n\n4. Success or building a good life is not an overnight even. It's a process. Some decisions turn out to be perfect. Some don't even make sense. And this process is different for every human being.\n\n5. You are gonna be X years old in 2030 anyway.

            "Well….A very long story. If i was in your place i would definitely retake NET and try my best to get back into NUST. Listen NUST is the top institution in this country like being a Nustian means u have achieved something really good. Nust offers u a full package from academic excellence to character development/grooming/charisma. And man the confidence Nust gives is unbeatable. If u utilise your time well in Nust, u will definitely be way ahead of your counterparts. And guuurrl, we all know our weaknesses, if u knew that u r weak in maths it means u r not that logical why the hell u chose a degree which requires logic at every step and u left Nust for Comsats. \n\nU would have consulted with a career counsellor before leaving nust. Idk man this was a huge blunder tbh, u don’t take career decisions on impulse. \n\nAdvice: Now listen, stop caring about your age, retake NET and get back to Nust, get your degree. Start researching about career opportunities in pakistan and masters programs in Germany, France and Finland. Must do internships and build good relations with your peers. If u get a good job here well done, save money and ultimately move for Masters in EU (EU offers several scholarship programs) and with Nust degree in hand, your CV will be far better than most of your competitors. So yeah, rmr every action has a consequence, now face yours. Accept the reality and do what will eventually reward u in long term.\n\n20-21 age is not much rmr. So stop thinking about age if marriage is not your primary goal for education",

        "body": "\nI went to buy KIPS books and noticed there were several categories, which left me really confused. I’ve also heard that the books you buy directly from a KIPS campus are different from the ones available online.\n\nI’m thinking about getting the ECAT series because it’s cheaper and seems to include almost every book I need to prepare for the NET. But I’m not sure whether these books are useful for other university entry tests as well (besides ECAT), since they’re labeled specifically for ECAT.\n\nSo, are the contents of both series the same? And will the ECAT series still help me prepare for other university admission tests.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1pi43ey)",

            "The Mathematics portion of NET (Business and Social Sciences) is mostly quantitative maths based on Grade 9–10 concepts. You don’t have to study every chapter in depth. What really matters is understanding the core concepts, the basic rules, and how to solve the common types of questions that appear in the test.\n\nThe topics you should focus on are basic algebra, quadratic equations, sets, matrices, fundamentals of trigonometry and geometry, arithmetic terms, ratios, fractions including LCM and HCF, factorisation, logarithms, probability, and basic statistics such as percentage, mean, median and mode. Once again, the goal is not to memorize everything but to have a clear understanding of how to apply the formulas and techniques.\n\nFor preparation, the Dogar Series NET B&SC book is genuinely useful, and many students also recommend the OETP book.\n\nFor the English section, the Dogar NET English book and past papers are extremely helpful. In fact, questions are often repeated from older papers. Try to learn at least 200 new vocabulary words because vocabulary plays a big role. Otherwise, the English portion is fairly simple if your basics are strong.\n\nTime management is very important. Always start with the section you are most comfortable with so you can secure quick marks and save time for the more challenging parts.\nIf you need any help, you can do lmk. \nGood luckk!",

            "I've given both. If you're planning to apply only in pakistan, unis have very varied requirements on whether sat is accepted (I only know it's accepted in lums/lse/social sciences for nust) and almost every uni has its own entrance test as an alternative which is much much cheaper. So better to just give that test instead\n\n\nFor the content of both, SAT is much easier in the maths section as it has desmos + calculator and has a shit ton of resources online to study from. For NET, maths is however much more to do with memorising and quick problem solving instead. The English section in the SAT is much harder for students overall tho as I hardly see ppl scoring more in English SAT.",

            "Yeah I just gave the additional math exam in November which was conducted in the annual 2 exam 2025 and I think I nailed it as well. Started prep slowly and at a steady pace after my second year exams ended by May 2025, took me around 3-4 months of focused study to bridge the FSC math gap (I studied for 6-8 hrs daily in this time period). I started slow with maths during the first month but gradually increased my pace as math is highly technical and will require lots of time to build your concepts. As you already mentioned that you're on gap year so you have a good opportunity to focus entirely on math. In my case I started asap after 2nd year exams ended because I already knew about add math exam so I was focused into clearing that firstly. You just need to pass the exam, I spent most of my study sessions focusing on solving the exercises, as the exam is modeled off from exercises and example questions mostly, you should focus lots of time on solving all of the exercises and being comfortable with solving related questions and in the end make sure you solve at least 5 past years papers as they'll be super helpful for feedback and revision. In your case since you're giving the April/May exam, additional math exam should be your second priority, focus on the NET angle of the Math first, if you are comfortable with solving the NET MCQs of Math you'll have little to no trouble with FSC Math since both of them have high overlap with their content. All you need is focus, dedication and extensive practice, good luck you got this, if you want to ask anything beyond this DM me.",

Kuch iupac names waghera bhi are the , memorize that . for English it's all luck ,me ne toh eng ke lie Kuch nahi parha , but u should prob study oetp for bio ,chem and eng too , past papers de Kuch mcqs ate hein . eng ke Liye imp he ke synonym antonym boht se kar lo . comprehension qs are easy in eng .",

I prepared from oetp and now I realize oetp is a  trash, only 10 or 20 mcqs are like that, other than that all mcqs were not easy, I did used kips for maths but only did derivatives and analytical geometry, what should I do to for net-2 especially for physics it wasn't book lines, also yesterday Options were confusing and my so much time was waste in finding the correct option.",

            "Tbh I've bounced between so many of these, it's kinda exhausting how nothing actually works the same every time. Rewritica was solid before, but lately results are hit or miss. \n\nWhat I usually do now is cycle through a few of the newer tools like AIDetectPlus, WinSton and sometimes aihumanizer. Feels like you have to mix and match to get something that actually slips past most detectors - especially when every site is using something different like gptzero or copyleaks. \n\nBro, which detector keeps catching you lately? Because sometimes if you tweak your writing for one, it gets flagged by another. It's so random.\n\nIf you find anything that's 100% pass rate, please update here cause everyone is chasing the same thing lol.",

It humanizes ai generated text by improving tone, sentence flow and natural structure often turning robotic drafts into writing that reads like your own.

I am 23F doing my masters at SEECS and he is also teaching in SEECS. He’s so respectful, soft-spoken, and genuinely kind. There’s something about the way he carries himself that just… pulls me in.\n\nI keep trying to push these feelings away because I know it’s not the right situation. I’m a master’s student, he teaches the bachelor’s class I assist in, and I don’t even know anything about his personal life. He just seems so composed and so impossible to ignore.\n\nI’m trying to handle it like a “normal crush,” but honestly, it’s starting to affect me more than I expected. I feel confused, embarrassed, and scared of crossing any line I shouldn’t. I have started developing feelings for him and started fantasizing him.\n\nI just needed to let this out somewhere safe. If anyone has honest advice or has been through something similar, I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts.\n\nAnd do not judge me on this...",

This is how the paper goes for anyone who's about to give.\n\nto get a good score, you don't have to optimize marks. rather aim for most marks per minute, write the time waster question numbers on the loose sheet and do those in the end, don't spend more than 15-20secs on the first attempt of a question.\n\nthe screen actually blinks at 54sec to tell you its time to move on.\n\nfor the test, as soon as it started i skipped to english and did those, and the ones i was doubtful about i wrote the question numbers next to an \"x\" on the back of my rough sheet.\n\nand rough sheet management is very important, it is essentially your RAM for the test. messy sheet means messy brain so make COLUMNS and dont move on until youve completely filled one, dont freehand and dont write in rows\n\nafter english i moved on to physics, and did only the theory ones and put C on the numercals and moved on, and wrote the question numbers next to a \"T\" on the back of my sheet (as in needs time), the ones i was doubtful/ needed confirmation i wrote next to a star on the back of my sheet.\n\nNET is more about nerve management during the exam, because it is 3 whole hours of constant pressure, at around 40mins i was done with english and a bit of physics, and at the one hour mark you should aim to be completely done with physics and english (apart from some long numerical if you left that for end)\n\ngeneral advice, for ones you have to completely blind guess, pick B or C (statistically most likely) and stick with one, and dont vary.\n\ndid maths in batches of 25, writing pretty sure but slightly doubtful questions under star, time taking ones under T for the end and X for the ones i didnt know\n\naim to finish the entire test at the 2 hour mark, and you will actually finish at around the 2.5hr mark, after that tackle the few annoying questions\n\ni counted the amount of questions i didnt know and they came around 20, with 20 more i was only 50/50\n\ndont forget to breath and drink water cuz its more of a roadtrip/ marathon than a sprint\n\nfor prep, i used google gemini 3 pro (very good ai) and i looked for past papers and asked ai for tricks, optimizations, memory tricks and overviews\n\nand yes, the NET is difficult. if ur from fbise youd know ke around 1 in 20 mcqs have a \"trick\" to them. for NET almost all mcqs are like that",

Math portion was good for me like I just did the major chapter and no proper practice except Integration just basic (now completed it) and did well on that portion 74 out of 100 like definitely can improve it by completing the syllabus and doing the KIPS Fung book. And for the physics portion I only got 33 out of 60 this is the main problem and the time management. In English portion I got 18 because of time management can do better than that like I had 5 minutes left for it and my 6 questions were not attempted. \n\n  \nNow I want advice that how to prepare for physics portion because what I have seen for that my paper was almost completely theory based and like 3 or 4 numerical similarly I asked my friends as well they said the same that there were only 5 to 9 numerical based on the exam. Please tell me how to prepare the physics portion so I can get 50 in it for NET 2 I have 2 months how to utilize them completely. Another question who gave multiple NET does the difficultly level increases or remains the same of questions? Is there any like list of synonyms and antonyms to prepare from share it if you have?\n\nI have joined Mathsflix batch Sir Bilal Zia is teaching there and all of the questions they teach are numerical based and lectures are like extremely long 2 hours lectures and 6 to 7 of chapters like Electrostatics and Current Electricity there are like 20 chapter of first year and second year how to prepare them properly so I can achieve good marks in physics portion. Please guide on the physics portion because I tried to find it from the previous posts but there was not much so yeah if I did the physics portion well I can definitely score well especially the ones who gave NET previous year. For math my syllabus is almost completed I just have to revise and a couple of minor chapters obviously have to practice daily from KIPS FUNG and Past papers\n\n  \nFor context I want to get into SEECS CS major so I guess I need 150+ but have to try for max",

        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m considering applying to NUST Islamabad for undergraduate in electrical engineering in the future, and while I’m personally excited, my parents have one major concern — the hostel environment. Their worry is more of the usual *\"mahol theek hoga ya nahi, bacha bigair na jaye\"* type. They’re surprisingly more comfortable with me studying abroad in countries like China, Japan and Malaysia than living in a Pakistani university hostel.\n\nA bit about me: I’m a 17M from Karachi, currently living in Dubai. I’m academically focused, planning to stick to a disciplined routine, and want to grow in a productive environment. I’m curious whether the NUST hostel culture supports this or makes it difficult.\n\nSo, I’d love to hear from people who have actually lived there — current students, alumni and hostel residents:\n\n* How is the environment in hostels realistically?\n* What’s the general routine and culture of hostels and the university like?\n* Is peer pressure towards smoking, late-night activities, etc. common or avoidable?\n* Is it possible to stay focused and maintain good company?\n* What role do roommates, societies, and academic pressure play in personal development?\n* Are there any green flags or red flags my parents should know?\n\nI’d love to hear your personal experiences — both good and bad.  \nWhat should a student expect, and what should parents know that might reassure them?\n\nThanks in advance. Any honest input is appreciated!",

            "No need to buy any course or join any academy. Get self disciplined. You will avoid burnout and get into NUST easily.\n\nAlso, most paid courses are a manjan. If you still want to buy, first get a trial period, warna pesai lutao gai.\n\nFirst cover your Fsc syllabus. Do it from books, youtube channels, do it one by one, chapter by chapter, make notes.\n\nHere's a google drive link to get you started with the resources: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/7/folders/1GFyegwO1xNDbFJ-hVUbBvIwnDlx0QzDN\n\nOnce done, start practicing.\n\nOETP is a starting point. Not enough for everything.\nAgain, before starting, first prep your syllabus. Make notes. Find shortcut methods. Remember that each mcq needs and can be solved in 50 seconds.\n\nOnce done, and you have understood the concepts, start practicing. Use OETP. Then move to other books.\n\nIf you don't want to use books and want to save yourself some money, you can sign up on www.parhlai.com. We have a HUGE Mcq bank and we're adding even more.\n\nThere are also AI based analytics too, so you can know your weak points and know where to work on.\n\nWe also have an AI chatbot, so its your own personal tutor, that will help you understand EVERYTHING that you don't understand.\n\nPS: there is also a resource bank we have created on www.parhlai.com, so you can check that out too.\n\nIf you have ANY other questions, feel free to DM at https://www.instagram.com/parhlai/"

I also don't live there so there's the full on protocol(and staying at aunts house so everyone knows ykkyk) \n\n\nSo now I'm also just gonna grind every single chapter because the paper is so random. So just get practice books (kips maybe?) And there are mock tests online. Practice from different sources so u can tackle different mcqs\n\n\nIn the end it's a good thing you gave it, next time you won't be so blank during the paper because you already are familiar with the atmosphere. Whatever you got wrong in the test, practice it's. Keep trying okk\n\n\nMOST importantly TAWAKALLAH like that's the only thing that will get u in (along with hard work) \n\n\nBut that's just what I think, even if u go to academics, in the end the self-study is important. But if u still think so, then go for it this is just my opinion. But at least give the net with your full tiyari first then get into academies. If it's just test you need, there are plenty of sources online,\n\n\nThere is also STEPS practice book, it's pretty fat lol with lots of mcqs so yeah. \n\n\nAlso I go to steps academy myself. Maybe in the test session in February it will actually make a difference, but till now it's nothing special, though I like their practice book. Maybe u can get that, like for the amount of money of an academy , u can buy practice books for like the 10th of that price. \n\n\nHelp btw it's not like I have gotten crazy marks myself But Inshallah we've got this :>\n\n\n(I also didn't rlly prepare physics 😛) ",

            "1.Book is your best friend . (Sb se phle book kro , porri a to z, read it , and learn important numericals and stuff by heart )\n2.practice practice and practice. (You may ask k practice kaha say, the answer is mathsfliz by hashim zia , just take the marathon and free youtube videos of sir hashim, no need to waste money on kips or even his paid course,) \n3.mind the time.\n4.mind that you are not preparing for boards. Dont try to kearn by heart and read unnecessary obvious info, just read the important stuff and remember the facts and figures . )\n5.in entry test, quantity matters more than quality most of the time,  knowing all only  important stuff of the whole book is better than learning half of it perfectly. \n6. Past paper are super important.\n\nNow for subject specifics .\n1.maths is all about practice, to be honest about 80 questions are not difficult, its just the time and pressure that makes the difference. Thus if you master time management and manage to keep yourself calm , boom maths is done . This is, if you are well prepared. About 20 ish questions are time suckers . \nSkip them and solve them later . MIND THAT dobt waste a second on them , else its no use skipping them, you already wasted your time on them , you should be immediately able to recognize kya aata hai aur kya nahi. Tbh all the topics are equally important, conics is over hyped , sb se equal aata hai . Conics is important though cause if you just understand the basics good enough you can solve most of the questions. Kets (kips notes are too difficult, itna mushkil nahi aata . Aur na hi zyada mushkil krne ka faida hai , they just suck your energy snd motivation)\n++ Literally book ki lines ayi pri hoti , the definition and corollary stuff\n2.Physics .. literally the easiest, numericals bht thorey aatey aur jo aatey b hai woh basic se hote hain , you can just guess them if you know the formulas .\n+LITERALLY book ki lines seedhi seedhi, without the slightest change. Just read the book tmand learn facts and figures by heart. And practice the mcqs. \n+Plus saari physics eik taraf hai aur second year ka second half ek taraf, its very important.\n3.english: yes it is going to be difficult and you may not know a single word in the whole question including options at time. And no learning 6000 words is not practical+ would not help .\nTHERE IS A CHEAT CODE and that is OETP. JUST DO THE OETP and inshallah you will be able to score like 30 makrs . Yes many words will repeat form it but the real thing is once you practice enough you start recognizing word tones and start guessing meanings . Practice is the key.\n\nThat was  the preparation, but 50 percent of your result depends on your attempt , so for that remember:\n1.overthinking kills ( be careful while solving the question but once you have marked an option, dont rethink. Even if it's a wild guess) \n2. Time is you greatest asset, use it wisely , (jo aata hai kro , jo nhi aata aagey chalo , though do consider making a random option on the ones you skip) \n3. Again, the questions are rather easy, just stay calm , (tension mein Jo aata hoga woh b bhool jaye ga so don't panic) \n4. Consider interacting with others and going for namaz once in the hall , it helped me calm down.",

The topics you need to know are the ones in the ptb books (maths and physics), and you need to get ALL of them down. the tests are random, they sometimes may have less questions from a topic but next time they might have more from it. there are no important chapters or topics here.\n\nId suggest that you get a good grip on kips fung. use oetp as a stepping stone. if you have a good grip on fung, getting 160+ isnt even that hard"

            "(i just hope you or someone actually reads this)\n1.Book is your best friend . (Sb se phle book kro , porri a to z, read it , and learn important numericals and stuff by heart )\n2.practice practice and practice. (You may ask k practice kaha say, the answer is mathsfliz by hashim zia , just take the marathon and free youtube videos of sir hashim, no need to waste money on kips or even his paid course,) \n3.mind the time.\n4.mind that you are not preparing for boards. Dont try to kearn by heart and read unnecessary obvious info, just read the important stuff and remember the facts and figures . )\n5.in entry test, quantity matters more than quality most of the time,  knowing all only  important stuff of the whole book is better than learning half of it perfectly. \n6. Past paper are super important.\n\nNow for subject specifics .\n1.maths is all about practice, to be honest about 80 questions are not difficult, its just the time and pressure that makes the difference. Thus if you master time management and manage to keep yourself calm , boom maths is done . This is, if you are well prepared. About 20 ish questions are time suckers . \nSkip them and solve them later . MIND THAT dobt waste a second on them , else its no use skipping them, you already wasted your time on them , you should be immediately able to recognize kya aata hai aur kya nahi. Tbh all the topics are equally important, conics is over hyped , sb se equal aata hai . Conics is important though cause if you just understand the basics good enough you can solve most of the questions. Kets (kips notes are too difficult, itna mushkil nahi aata . Aur na hi zyada mushkil krne ka faida hai , they just suck your energy snd motivation)\n++ Literally book ki lines ayi pri hoti , the definition and corollary stuff\n2.Physics .. literally the easiest, numericals bht thorey aatey aur jo aatey b hai woh basic se hote hain , you can just guess them if you know the formulas .\n+LITERALLY book ki lines seedhi seedhi, without the slightest change. Just read the book tmand learn facts and figures by heart. And practice the mcqs. \n+Plus saari physics eik taraf hai aur second year ka second half ek taraf, its very important.\n3.english: yes it is going to be difficult and you may not know a single word in the whole question including options at time. And no learning 6000 words is not practical+ would not help .\nTHERE IS A CHEAT CODE and that is OETP. JUST DO THE OETP and inshallah you will be able to score like 30 makrs . Yes many words will repeat form it but the real thing is once you practice enough you start recognizing word tones and start guessing meanings . Practice is the key.\nThat was  the preparation, but 50 percent of your result depends on your attempt , so for that remember:\n1.overthinking kills ( be careful while solving the question but once you have marked an option, dont rethink. Even if it's a wild guess) \n2. Time is you greatest asset, use it wisely , (jo aata hai kro , jo nhi aata aagey chalo , though do consider making a random option on the ones you skip) \n3. Again, the questions are rather easy, just stay calm , (tension mein Jo aata hoga woh b bhool jaye ga so don't panic) \n4. Consider interacting with others and going for namaz once in the hall , it helped me calm down.",

Does that mean no one else will ever get a chance to prove anything?\nEven in societies like ncsc, it’s the same old faces year after year. It’s honestly exhausting.

Only one or two “lucky” people get in by warna sab nay apnay doston ko andar karvana hota hai  and all these “saints” are abusing their positions.\nAnd then inside departments, it’s a whole different drama. People use you, take advantage of you, and then stab you in the back when it benefits them. I’m so sick of it. I hate this whole system.

And also what should be my strategy for preparation, there are about 200 words of vocabulary from Past Papers, should i go through them all? \n3. How do you guys even prep for NETs?\n4. Is there some sort of trend in NETs that the question from past papers are repeated in papers?\n5. Plus for the mathematics parts, i am just overviewing the topics and pretty much reviving my maths from grade 9-10. (i was in pre med). Any advices?\n\nIf anyone can answer my questions, i would really appreciate it🤧🥹\n\nPeace out ✌🏻❤️",

Not sure if this is the right place to be asking but going ahead anyway. \nI've studied upto college (F.A) after which i decided to pursue my area of interest rather than follow the path to university. \nI spent 4 yrs studying religious subjects in an institution, while their course was AMAZING, it sadly wasn't affiliated with wifaaq, which means the degree isn't convertible to bachelors/masters.\nI spent around 2 years (1 before and 1 after this degree) working in teaching kindergarten and second at the same place I studied from. 3 years at home after I got married.\nNow im looking to continue my studies ( basically to just get a degree) what are my options?\n\nI want a university whose degrees hold value but isn't too expensive. \nI want to study something that has potential for decent paying jobs later.\n\nI've studied English literature during college and extensive Arabic during my 4 yr study at the institute.  Should I get into these languages as a degree or pursue something else? \nIslamic studies is an option someone mentioned as well.\nThese degrees will likely provide only teaching opportunities, is there scope and decent earnings there? \nWhich of these, or none, would be advisable? And what other options should I look into?\nThank you in advance!\n",

            "Hey fellow Redditor. \n\nFirst of all, I'm glad that you're returning back to education/planning to persue a professional degree. \nSecond of all, of you have studied before in some institute, it is a great opportunity for you to decide something that works best with your INTEREST. Something that inspires you and you think will be long lasting in the practical field with skills. \nIf you think you're good at Arabic, which I suppose you will be. Then please get a degree similar to something language. Second of all, don't think that a degree will guarantee you a Job. I don't want to let you down but trust me the market is already very saturated and highly competitive. \nIf you're thinking to pursue some degree in any language, then ask yourself how that degree will help you finding job or your passion, if you want to teach in future or work at some embassy or some institute as a language instructor or do something of your own. \nThese 4 years of bachelors will definitely help you navigate alot and make better decision in future, but for once do ask yourself what you want to do with that particular degree and scope does it has and how will it impact your future especially with marriage. Glad to answer your question. If you more please feel free to reach out. I was somewhat in same boat as yours 3 years ago, thought I had lost everything in life but Alhumdullilah, I'm pursuing B.B.A and doing great in my life. I wasted 2.5 years of my life in a degree which I never felt right about. But, being late doesn't make me weak or old. I made great friends and learnt alot by switching my degree. Best of luck!!",
            "Better options for someone like you who practisces religion or studied in that field would be ISLAMIC INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY, secondly it's very affordable and cheaper than other universities like NUST, FAST, Bahria and Air. \nI'm not saying these university are bed, they are just more expensive than Islamic. But, if you're willing to have a campus life and exposure then these mentioned university are best options. Islamic is also good university but, I personally think you will be stuck in a loop of all girls and not being to able to enjoy that uni life. Else all depends on what you're looking for and what suits with your lifestyle and works better for your spouse. JazakAllah!",
            "Thanks alot for such an honest response, so glad for you as well ❤️  I actually loved studying Arabic and religious sciences, only regret not having gotten a degree. \nI feel I would love teaching as a job as well in the future, to older students where I can hopefully have an impact, only worried about the job market, as you mentioned as well. Is there more of a scope in english compared to arabic, if you have any idea? Or the islamic studies option.",
            "Had the same thoughts on unis, except for numl, which is hear is reputable for degrees in language?\nI don't much care the uni life experience, but I do care for having a degree from a university that has a great rep.",
            "English is very common degree attained by many people but only few people knew how to excel in it. Other went for research (PH.d) or just sitting as housewifes or some private school teacher. \nBut, I personally think Arabic is a great language and in coming future it will help you alot if you're thinking to teach it to adults. It also helps in Shariah Law (Isalmic Law). Only Islamic International University is doing Shariah Law. Please research on that. That degree is complete fiqh, hadith and Quran teachings and laws on based on mostly Arabic Language. You should focus on something that also gives you skills and also collaborate with real-time technology. \n\nYou're not behind or late sister. Please don't think you've lost anything. Everyone has their own TIMELINE. Everyone is on their own journey!!",
            "Numl doesn't have a great educational value anymore. NUST, bahria, Fast, Air are better options than numl in my opinion. Yes, a degree from a reputable degree is a great impact.",
            "Appreciate your kindess alot ❤️\nI did hear about shariah law in iiui from my husband actually, its similar to his field. \nI'm not sure if it's very tough or not, but i probably should have a look regardless. Thanks for the thought.\n\nAs for arabic, do you think there's more job options there? Someone suggested that in terms of jobs, english might be better than arabic.",
            "I was under the impression that while these universities are weighty, it was more so in sciences and certain other areas. Would a language degree from a uni that is more well known for other subjects be as valuable?",
            "can u elaborate on why u think about that for numl  it's kinda degrading for students that are already studying there!!?",
            "I really don't know about many jobs after English degree. But, I would suggest don't do a degree for seeking a job. Seek something that will help you in future if the job market crashes, like skills. Soft skills.  Like computing, technology, CV building, Etc. \nAlso for English, bachelors is not enough now. You will have to study more than Bachelors such as, MPhil or Masters in further english because the market is loaded with Post Graduates in Masters and the question is ehy would they choose you ehen there are more people with Post Graduate in English. So finding a good job will be a tough part. But, you if you wnat to go with something easy and that you can handle with married life, then definitely go with English language. \n\nShariah law is definitely something that will suit with your taste and previous experience. And as a business student, I can assure that Pakistan will be following Sharahia Law in banking fields soon. So, it something that really intrigued me. \n\nAlthough, I have some acquaintance in IIUI who are persuing Shariah Law and heard that it is a little tough and requires lots of attention and focus as mostly things are in Arabic Language. But, it is something very interesting. \nIf your spouse is somewhat similar field, then it woll definitely help you out more in the future. You will need lots of commitment with Shariah Law. It eill take your time and energy. On the other hand, English will not take as much energy and time of yours with your married life responsibilities.",
            "There are millions with English Degree and bachelor's let alone is not enough. You will definitely need to study further and more as Post Graduate, which will add you extra few years if you can really find a job that works best for you.",
            "Yes you're right, conversions towards islamic banking are on a roll right now. \nYes that was my main concern, it might be tough, and after many years of lazing about, I'm afraid of jumping into something tough lol, but i will definitely look into it and gauge myself objectively.\nAs for english, yep, definitely will.have to study further to make it of any value.\nBut thank you for your help, I'll keep all this in mind In shaa'Allah!",
            "It was a pleasure. Feel free to reach out. Don't be scared. Your husband seems a supportive person mashaAllah mashaAllah. I hope and pray everyone get someone like this. Keep it going. Don't give up at any point. Just do more research that will work best for you with your married life routine. Don't commit with something that might make your life tough. Handling home is the biggest duty.",
            "He definitely is Alhamdulillah, may Allah bless him. And you for your help!\n\nDefinitely going to be careful not to overcommit. Will take you up on the offer if I have any questions!"

            "If u want to opt for masters ABROAD, all that matters is CGPA.. the better the gpa, better the chances of getting scholarships, better gpa means u wont be at the mercy of universities choosing you, at the very least u would be able to apply in the city you want.\n\nIf you think top universities will boost your academic performances, NOT A CHANCE !!\n\nIn IT, no amount of big name institutes will boost your skills better than working in the actual industry.\nIn Pakistan, big IT names like FAST means strict grading criteria, more workload, not very lenient attendance policies and expensive credit hours.\n\nIf we talk about “getting more opportunities by studying in a big name university”,  the moment you do your first internship you will realise its all bogus.\n\nYes these top universities might offer better JOB FAIRS but you can easily sneak into any university’s job fair.\n\nIf you are a “prospective software engineer” who wants to “study abroad”  your priorities should be your GPA alongside a dope portfolio. A big institute’s name doesnt do shit, even more so in tech industry.\n\nIf you think you can learn skills by yourself without having a danda on your head then you should opt for any university which you can afford.\n\nAnd lets be real FEES is not the only expense that comes with university;\n-> the travelling costs\n-> if you are moving to a different city than the hostel expenses\n-> the social gatherings costs\n\nand lastly i should also add this, no matter the university you go to, join as many societies as you can. The exposure you will get by working in those societies and organising events will be extraordinary.\n\nEdit:\nthe faculty should be the least of your worries in choosing an institute. There are good faculty and bad faculty members in every dept of every university. So dont bother with that. \n\nYour best teachers will be on youtube, and for IT most of the good teachers you will find will be on youtube xD",
            "Bro honestly, it all depends on what you want from the university.\nIm from NBS department and pursuing my bachelor's of Business Administration (BBA). \nPeople said agar \"BBA hi krna hai to Islamic ya Fast se krlo, why pay huge sums of money at NUST\".\nI really don't care about what others say. I am clearly aware what i want from Nust.\nIm not here to just learn theoretical business rather make connections, perform in presentations and public speaking communities so that when i graduate im able enough to articulate my say. I have good communication skills. Btw im an introvert person but nust is really a place that helps me build skills and interact with the Islamabad's most intellect people.\nIf you don't force yourself to excel then don't expect a miracle landing you a good job.\nDegree to degree hi hai, you gotta make yourself valuable.",
            "seecs faculty aint that good, fee is getting higher and higher, and cgpa is not easy to get. those are the facts\n\nI came here a bit over 2 years ago (cs), and do not regret it at all. even if today i had the choice of going to any uni in pakistan, well id probably choose lums, but nust would come 2nd. Maybe there is a bit of bias in that, but its a love/hate relationship so maybe not\n\nif you get in lums, go for it. id still advise you to avoid fast tho, better nust than fast.\n\nBut if your goal is to solely go for masters abroad, easiest way would be to get into a non-competitive university and easily get a good cgpa",
            "Been a while since I graduated , actually a decade ... But what NUST offers which FAST does not is more international collaboration and better international repute when it comes to academic .",
            "I'm also applying this year, so ig seniors would help you out better, but since I'm also planning for masters abroad in the future, I would recommend that NUST is the best option here. The reason I say it is because LUMS is just not worth the 30 lacs/year, and LUMS is more known for business degrees. As for FAST, I would say that FAST mein ragra bohot hai, and usually they don't give GPA easily. You would prolly need to sacrifice social life ig, and as for the fee, FAST and NUST dono ki cost pretty much same hai.",
            "Concern about fees and considering LUMS does not go hand in hand. LUMS is extremely expensive so I don't think you are concerned about fees.\n\nIf market preparation, teachers and not so much the fees are a concern, there is a non-traditional path available in Pakistan which gives you a guarantee that you get a Bachelor's in a foreign university, unless of course you fail.\n\nOpt for Higher National Diploma (2 years, 4-6 semesters), its UK vocational diploma and has largely practical coursework. 3 hours a day classes in which you are made to learn through assignments. Cost is 200-700k for the whole program. Its HEC recognized and many institutions offer it.\n\nYou can take 1 year in any university affiliated with the British Council to upgrade it to a Bachelor's Degree. This includes many top universities all over the world. You just need to apply and have grades above a level defined by the university, there is no admission test, its direct induction.\n\nMy brother took this route, he did it at Edwards College Peshawar, all the teachers were foreign and vetted by the British Council. He took up the third year extension to bachelors degree in Northumbria University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. He also did his masters there.\n\nHe didn't get very good grades in HND, under 70%, so he had to self finance and Oxford was very expensive, thus, the choice.",

The difference between military and civilian culture and mannerism is extremely bare and contrasting, resulting in majority of the students having this complaint.\n\nIt was the same when I worked there in 2012 and its the same now.",
            "100%\n\npeople seem to forget that a uni is supposed to provide way more than just a degree",
            "> \"BBA hi krna hai to Islamic ya Fast se krlo,\n\nLol university matters alot in Non Stem especially in non cs programs. Youre also kind of throwing fast under the bus by comparing it with Islamic but i still think nust is better if you dont take fee into account. Btw, how is Nbs faring you as an introverted person? I guess there is a difference between being an introvert and being socially awkward"

I solved 2x2 matrix determinant and got it wrong like 3 times. I forgot basic concepts and it felt like i had never studied for it. I received the result today and i got 100. \n\nI am extremely heartbroken, my parents expected alot from me and they are really disappointed too. Ik many fellows who gave the test without even studying and they got like 100-110. Ik i still have 3 more attempts and i can easily increase my score to 150 or maybe even 160 but seeing myself perform so dumbly even after working so hard really broke my motivation to study any further. There really isn't any point of writing this I just wanted to pour my heart out. I just can't figure out where i went wrong. ",

            "Heyy, I’m really glad you shared this. What you went through is something so many people experience, but almost no one talks about. Test anxiety can hit hard, even when you’ve put in real work. It doesn’t mean you’re incapable, it means you were overwhelmed in one moment, not that you’re lacking ability.\n\nAnd please hear this: none of that effort was wasted. Every hour you studied built understanding, discipline, and resilience. That doesn’t disappear because one test went wrong. It’s not a loss, I repeat it's never a loss. In fact It’s experience, the kind that will actually help you handle the next attempt better.\n\nYou’ve got more chances, and you know you can score higher. You even said it yourself. One bad day doesn’t define your future. What matters is that you don’t give up on yourself just because you stumbled. It’s only over if you walk away, and you’re clearly someone who won’t.\n\nBe gentle with yourself. You cared, you tried, and that already says a lot about your potential. I believe you can still do this. Truly. Take a breath, rest a little, and then return when you’re ready, with the experience of this attempt behind you instead of weighing on you.\n\nYou’re not alone, and this isn’t the end. It’s just a beginning that didn’t go the way you hoped, but beginnings can still lead somewhere great. Trust Allah's plan, He is the best of planners. Have patience with it, Allah will reward you for your hard-work, it won't be wasted.\n\n**\"Once you make a decision, put your trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves those who trust in Him\"**  \n(Quran 3:159)",

            "Engineering or business ?",
            "Don't worry brother, Allah will help you as you have worked hard. Same thing happened to me last year I studied a lot but just wasn't able to score much in the nets but still got into my desired field. Don't be heartbroken and gloomy cheerup. Inshallah you will be able to do it. Disappointment will make your mind a dark place so cheerup and study hard for the next net inshallah you will be able to get into your desired field.",

            "I’m in the same boat as you, i thought i was the only one with this situation but well you never know haha, i gave 3 nets last year, couldn’t score well cuz of my own laziness and just the mindset of like i could take a gap year and prepare for it the next year, watched so manyyy seasons, for reference( Dexter- that was peak and on the anime side there were so manyy but main were like Monster- amazing, and many more) and just wasted time like that, took a gap year and guess what, i wasted june and july, then on 17th of aug, i took a piece of paper and pencil and did some self reflection, fast forward to this day 27th nov, ive completed my maths bus integration reh gayi hay and english is on the way, my physics is weak or should i say i havent put the effort but InshaAllah second attempt me krloonga, THE MAIN THING THAT I HAVE LEARNED THE HARD WAY IS FREAKING EXECUTING RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THAT PERFECT DAY-TIME. man this helped me a lotttt, just start doing from today, i cant stress how much imp this is, from my past experience, the only thing diff in me is that i think less and i start doing, i didnt look back k yaar itna time waste krliya or ab to time bhi kam reh gaya hay ab kese kroonga- nahh fuck that- its never too late UNTIL IT ACTUALLY IS\nSo please just STOP thinking and start doing from today, and most importantly whatever you do today you have to repeat the cycle tomorrow or it wont benefit you\nBaaki my prayers are with you, May Allah help us succeed in our hardships Ameen. \nI’m preparing for CS",

            "Hey there. I am a freshie in acf nbs rn. I feel your pain and fear. I too went through the same thing the past whole year fearing I might fail to get into an uni. But in the end I got in all the unis I had focused on except one and choose Nust for convenience as it is still away from my home but I feel it's worth it. I was in the same boat about Acca but my father told me to enjoy uni life bcz honestly acca prep is just a tuition. Anyways I gave net 1 preparing from oetp and got decent marks and gave net 4 later and got less decent marks bcz I HATE MATHS. And I was a O and A levels student myself and got an A in maths O levels as well. For practice I will recommend going through some maths topic from matric and fsc books only those topic in which you struggle and for eng just go through basic vocab and some SAT vocab words. And for self confidence just take my example of a timid under confident boy who didn't even think he will get into any uni to a freshie at acf nbs. Just be a bit discipline and you got it. I wasn't a great student myself and I know you can do much better IA and don't get disheartened by your NET results and learn from your mistakes to bounce back. Pro tip give all the remaining Nets and aim for 135 no matter your equivalence and you are set to be in the first list eaz. You got it girl!!",
